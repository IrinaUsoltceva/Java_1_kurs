LIES
A

UNREGARDED
YELLOW
SUN
ORBITING
THIS
AT
A
DISTANCE
OF
ROUGHLY
NINETY
TWO
MILLION
MILES
IS
AN
UTTERLY
INSIGNIFICANT
LITTLE
BLUE
GREEN
PLANET
WHOSE
APE
DESCENDED
LIFE
FORMS
ARE
SO
AMAZINGLY
PRIMITIVE
THAT
THEY
STILL
THINK
DIGITAL
WATCHES
ARE
A
PRETTY
NEAT
IDEA
THIS
PLANET
HAS
OR
RATHER
HAD
A
PROBLEM
WHICH
WAS
THIS
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
ON
IT
WERE
UNHAPPY
FOR
PRETTY
MUCH
OF
THE
TIME
MANY
SOLUTIONS
WERE
SUGGESTED
FOR
THIS
PROBLEM
BUT
MOST
OF
THESE
WERE
LARGELY
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
MOVEMENTS
OF
SMALL
GREEN
PIECES
OF
PAPER
WHICH
IS
ODD
BECAUSE
ON
THE
WHOLE
IT
WASN
T
THE
SMALL
GREEN
PIECES
OF
PAPER
THAT
WERE
UNHAPPY
AND
SO
THE
PROBLEM
REMAINED
LOTS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WERE
MEAN
AND
MOST
OF
THEM
WERE
MISERABLE
EVEN
THE
ONES
WITH
DIGITAL
WATCHES
MANY
WERE
INCREASINGLY
OF
THE
OPINION
THAT
THEY
D
ALL
MADE
A
BIG
MISTAKE
IN
COMING
DOWN
FROM
THE
TREES
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
AND
SOME
SAID
THAT
EVEN
THE
TREES
HAD
BEEN
A
BAD
MOVE
AND
THAT
NO
ONE
SHOULD
EVER
HAVE
LEFT
THE
OCEANS
AND
THEN
ONE
THURSDAY
NEARLY
TWO
THOUSAND
YEARS
AFTER
ONE
MAN
HAD
BEEN
NAILED
TO
A
TREE
FOR
SAYING
HOW
GREAT
IT
WOULD
BE
TO
BE
NICE
TO
PEOPLE
FOR
A
CHANGE
ONE
GIRL
SITTING
ON
HER
OWN
IN
A
SMALL
CAFE
IN
RICKMANSWORTH
SUDDENLY
REALIZED
WHAT
IT
WAS
THAT
HAD
BEEN
GOING
WRONG
ALL
THIS
TIME
AND
SHE
FINALLY
KNEW
HOW
THE
WORLD
COULD
BE
MADE
A
GOOD
AND
HAPPY
PLACE
THIS
TIME
IT
WAS
RIGHT
IT
WOULD
WORK
AND
NO
ONE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
GET
NAILED
TO
ANYTHING
SADLY
HOWEVER
BEFORE
SHE
COULD
GET
TO
A
PHONE
TO
TELL
ANYONE
ABOUT
IT
A
TERRIBLY
STUPID
CATASTROPHE
OCCURRED
AND
THE
IDEA
WAS
LOST
FOREVER
THIS
IS
NOT
HER
STORY
BUT
IT
IS
THE
STORY
OF
THAT
TERRIBLE
STUPID
CATASTROPHE
AND
SOME
OF
ITS
CONSEQUENCES
IT
IS
ALSO
THE
STORY
OF
A
BOOK
A
BOOK
CALLED
THE
HITCH
HIKER
S
GUIDE
TO
THE
GALAXY
NOT
AN
EARTH
BOOK
NEVER
PUBLISHED
ON
EARTH
AND
UNTIL
THE
TERRIBLE
CATASTROPHE
OCCURRED
NEVER
SEEN
OR
HEARD
OF
BY
ANY
EARTHMAN
NEVERTHELESS
A
WHOLLY
REMARKABLE
BOOK
IN
FACT
IT
WAS
PROBABLY
THE
MOST
REMARKABLE
BOOK
EVER
TO
COME
OUT
OF
THE
GREAT
PUBLISHING
HOUSES
OF
URSA
MINOR
OF
WHICH
NO
EARTHMAN
HAD
EVER
HEARD
EITHER
NOT
ONLY
IS
IT
A
WHOLLY
REMARKABLE
BOOK
IT
IS
ALSO
A
HIGHLY
SUCCESSFUL
ONE
MORE
POPULAR
THAN
THE
CELESTIAL
HOME
CARE
OMNIBUS
BETTER
SELLING
THAN
FIFTY
MORE

ZERO
GRAVITY
AND
MORE
CONTROVERSIAL

S
TRILOGY
OF
PHILOSOPHICAL
BLOCKBUSTERS
WHERE
GOD
WENT

SOME
MORE
OF
GOD
S
GREATEST
MISTAKES
AND
WHO
IS
THIS
GOD
PERSON
ANYWAY
IN
MANY
OF
THE
MORE
RELAXED
CIVILIZATIONS
ON
THE
OUTER
EASTERN
RIM
OF
THE
GALAXY
THE
HITCH
HIKER
S
GUIDE
HAS
ALREADY
SUPPLANTED
THE
GREAT
ENCYCLOPEDIA
GALACTICA
AS
THE
STANDARD
REPOSITORY
OF
ALL
KNOWLEDGE
AND
WISDOM
FOR
THOUGH
IT
HAS
MANY
OMISSIONS
AND
CONTAINS
MUCH
THAT
IS
APOCRYPHAL
OR
AT
LEAST
WILDLY
INACCURATE
IT
SCORES
OVER
THE
OLDER
MORE
PEDESTRIAN
WORK
IN
TWO
IMPORTANT
RESPECTS
FIRST
IT
IS
SLIGHTLY
CHEAPER
AND
SECONDLY
IT
HAS
THE
WORDS
DON
T
PANIC
INSCRIBED
IN
LARGE
FRIENDLY
LETTERS
ON
ITS
COVER
BUT
THE
STORY
OF
THIS
TERRIBLE
STUPID
THURSDAY
THE
STORY
OF
ITS
EXTRAORDINARY
CONSEQUENCES
AND
THE
STORY
OF
HOW
THESE
CONSEQUENCES
ARE
INEXTRICABLY
INTERTWINED
WITH
THIS
REMARKABLE
BOOK
BEGINS
VERY
SIMPLY
IT
BEGINS
WITH
A
HOUSE
CHAPTER
1
THE
HOUSE
STOOD
ON
A
SLIGHT
RISE
JUST
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
VILLAGE
IT
STOOD
ON
ITS
OWN
AND
LOOKED
OVER
A
BROAD
SPREAD
OF
WEST
COUNTRY
FARMLAND
NOT
A
REMARKABLE
HOUSE
BY
ANY
MEANS
IT
WAS
ABOUT
THIRTY
YEARS
OLD
SQUATTISH
SQUARISH
MADE
OF
BRICK
AND
HAD
FOUR
WINDOWS
SET
IN
THE
FRONT
OF
A
SIZE
AND
PROPORTION
WHICH
MORE
OR
LESS
EXACTLY
FAILED
TO
PLEASE
THE
EYE
THE
ONLY
PERSON
FOR
WHOM
THE
HOUSE
WAS
IN
ANY
WAY
SPECIAL
WAS
ARTHUR
DENT
AND
THAT
WAS
ONLY
BECAUSE
IT
HAPPENED
TO
BE
THE
ONE
HE
LIVED
IN
HE
HAD
LIVED
IN
IT
FOR
ABOUT
THREE
YEARS
EVER
SINCE
HE
HAD
MOVED
OUT
OF
LONDON
BECAUSE
IT
MADE
HIM
NERVOUS
AND
IRRITABLE
HE
WAS
ABOUT
THIRTY
AS
WELL
DARK
HAIRED
AND
NEVER
QUITE
AT
EASE
WITH
HIMSELF
THE
THING
THAT
USED
TO
WORRY
HIM
MOST
WAS
THE
FACT
THAT
PEOPLE
ALWAYS
USED
TO
ASK
HIM
WHAT
HE
WAS
LOOKING
SO
WORRIED
ABOUT
HE
WORKED
IN
LOCAL
RADIO
WHICH
HE
ALWAYS
USED
TO
TELL
HIS
FRIENDS
WAS
A
LOT
MORE
INTERESTING
THAN
THEY
PROBABLY
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
TOO
MOST
OF
HIS
FRIENDS
WORKED
IN
ADVERTISING
IT
HADN
T
PROPERLY
REGISTERED
WITH
ARTHUR
THAT
THE
COUNCIL
WANTED
TO

WITH
FIFTEEN
SECONDS
LATER
HE
WAS
OUT
OF

AND
LYING
IN

OF
A
BIG
YELLOW
BULLDOZER
THAT
WAS
ADVANCING
UP
HIS
GARDEN

DESCENDED
FROM
AN
APE
MORE
SPECIFICALLY
HE
WAS
FORTY
FAT
AND
SHABBY
AND
WORKED
FOR
THE

CURIOUSLY
ENOUGH
THOUGH
HE
DIDN

KNOW
IT
HE
WAS
ALSO
A
DIRECT
MALE

THOUGH
INTERVENING
GENERATIONS
AND
RACIAL
MIXING
HAD
SO
JUGGLED
HIS
GENES
THAT
HE
HAD
NO
DISCERNIBLE
MONGOLOID
CHARACTERISTICS
AND
THE
ONLY
VESTIGES
LEFT
IN
MR
L
PROSSER
OF
HIS
MIGHTY
ANCESTRY
WERE
A
PRONOUNCED
STOUTNESS
ABOUT
THE
TUM
AND
A
PREDILECTION
FOR
LITTLE
FUR
HATS
HE
WAS
BY
NO
MEANS
A
GREAT
WARRIOR
IN
FACT
HE
WAS
A
NERVOUS
WORRIED
MAN
TODAY
HE
WAS
PARTICULARLY
NERVOUS
AND
WORRIED
BECAUSE
SOMETHING
HAD
GONE
SERIOUSLY
WRONG
WITH
HIS
JOB
WHICH
WAS
TO

PEOPLE
TO
DRIVE
FROM

VERY
FAST
WHILST
OTHER

TO
POINT
A
VERY
FAST
PEOPLE
LIVING
AT
POINT
C
BEING
A
POINT
DIRECTLY
IN

ARE
OFTEN
GIVEN
TO
WONDER
WHAT

SO
GREAT
ABOUT

THAT
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
OF

B
ARE
SO
KEEN
TO
GET
THERE
AND
WHAT

GREAT
ABOUT

THAT
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
OF

THEY
OFTEN
WISH
THAT
PEOPLE
WOULD
JUST
ONCE
AND
FOR
ALL
WORK
OUT
WHERE
THE

THEY
WANTED
TO
BE
MR
PROSSER
WANTED
TO
BE
AT
POINT
D
POINT
D
WASN
T
ANYWHERE
IN
PARTICULAR
IT
WAS
JUST
ANY
CONVENIENT
POINT
A
VERY
LONG
WAY
FROM
POINTS
A
B
AND
C
HE
WOULD
HAVE
A
NICE
LITTLE
COTTAGE
AT
POINT
D
WITH
AXES
OVER
THE
DOOR
AND
SPEND
A
PLEASANT
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
AT
POINT
E
WHICH
WOULD
BE
THE
NEAREST
PUB
TO
POINT
D
HIS
WIFE
OF
COURSE
WANTED
CLIMBING
ROSES
BUT
HE
WANTED
AXES
HE
DIDN
T
KNOW
WHY
HE
JUST
LIKED
AXES
HE
FLUSHED
HOTLY
UNDER
THE
DERISIVE
GRINS
OF
THE
BULLDOZER
DRIVERS
HE
SHIFTED
HIS
WEIGHT
FROM
FOOT
TO
FOOT
BUT
IT
WAS
EQUALLY
UNCOMFORTABLE
ON
EACH
OBVIOUSLY
SOMEBODY
HAD
BEEN
APPALLINGLY
INCOMPETENT
AND
HE
HOPED
TO
GOD
IT
WASN
T
HIM
MR
PROSSER
SAID
YOU
WERE
QUITE
ENTITLED
TO
MAKE
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
OR
PROTESTS
AT
THE
APPROPRIATE
TIME
YOU
KNOW
APPROPRIATE
TIME
HOOTED
ARTHUR
APPROPRIATE
TIME
THE
FIRST
I
KNEW
ABOUT
IT
WAS
WHEN
A
WORKMAN
ARRIVED
AT
MY
HOME
YESTERDAY
I
ASKED
HIM
IF
HE
D
COME
TO
CLEAN
THE
WINDOWS
AND
HE
SAID
NO
HE
D
COME
TO
DEMOLISH
THE
HOUSE
HE
DIDN
T
TELL
ME
STRAIGHT
AWAY
OF
COURSE
OH
NO
FIRST
HE
WIPED
A
COUPLE
OF
WINDOWS
AND
CHARGED
ME
A
FIVER
THEN
HE
TOLD
ME
BUT
MR
DENT
THE
PLANS
HAVE
BEEN
AVAILABLE
IN
THE
LOCAL
PLANNING
OFFICE
FOR
THE
LAST
NINE
MONTH
OH

WELL
AS
SOON
AS
I
HEARD
I
WENT
STRAIGHT
ROUND
TO
SEE
THEM
YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON
YOU
HADN
T
EXACTLY
GONE
OUT
OF
YOUR
WAY
TO
CALL
ATTENTION
TO
THEM
HAD
YOU
I
MEAN
LIKE
ACTUALLY
TELLING
ANYBODY
OR
ANYTHING
BUT
THE
PLANS
WERE
ON
DISPLAY
ON
DISPLAY
I
EVENTUALLY
HAD
TO
GO
DOWN
TO
THE
CELLAR
TO
FIND
THEM
THAT
S
THE
DISPLAY
DEPARTMENT
WITH
A
TORCH
AH
WELL
THE
LIGHTS

THE
STAIRS
BUT
LOOK

THE
NOTICE
DIDN
T
YOU

SAID
ARTHUR
YES
I
DID
IT
WAS
ON
DISPLAY
IN
THE
BOTTOM
OF
A
LOCKED
FILING
CABINET
STUCK
IN
A
DISUSED
LAVATORY
WITH
A
SIGN
ON
THE
DOOR
SAYING
BEWARE
OF
THE
LEOPARD
A
CLOUD
PASSED
OVERHEAD
IT
CAST
A
SHADOW
OVER
ARTHUR
DENT
AS
HE
LAY
PROPPED
UP
ON
HIS
ELBOW
IN
THE
COLD
MUD
IT
CAST
A
SHADOW
OVER
ARTHUR
DENT
S
HOUSE
MR
PROSSER
FROWNED
AT
IT
IT
S
NOT
AS
IF
IT
S
A
PARTICULARLY
NICE
HOUSE
HE
SAID
I
M
SORRY
BUT
I
HAPPEN
TO
LIKE
IT
YOU
LL
LIKE
THE
BYPASS
OH
SHUT
UP
SAID
ARTHUR
DENT
SHUT
UP
AND
GO
AWAY
AND
TAKE
YOUR
BLOODY
BYPASS
WITH
YOU
YOU
HAVEN
T
GOT
A
LEG
TO
STAND
ON
AND
YOU
KNOW
IT
MR
PROSSER
S
MOUTH
OPENED
AND
CLOSED
A
COUPLE
OF
TIMES
WHILE
HIS
MIND
WAS
FOR
A
MOMENT
FILLED
WITH
INEXPLICABLE
BUT
TERRIBLY
ATTRACTIVE
VISIONS
OF
ARTHUR
DENT
S
HOUSE
BEING
CONSUMED
WITH
FIRE
AND
ARTHUR
HIMSELF
RUNNING
SCREAMING
FROM
THE
BLAZING
RUIN
WITH
AT
LEAST
THREE
HEFTY
SPEARS
PROTRUDING
FROM
HIS
BACK
MR
PROSSER
WAS
OFTEN
BOTHERED
WITH
VISIONS
LIKE
THESE
AND
THEY
MADE
HIM
FEEL
VERY
NERVOUS
HE
STUTTERED
FOR
A
MOMENT
AND
THEN
PULLED
HIMSELF
TOGETHER
MR
DENT
HE
SAID
HELLO
YES
SAID
ARTHUR
SOME
FACTUAL
INFORMATION
FOR
YOU
HAVE
YOU
ANY
IDEA
HOW
MUCH
DAMAGE
THAT
BULLDOZER
WOULD
SUFFER
IF
I
JUST
LET
IT
ROLL
STRAIGHT
OVER
YOU
HOW
MUCH
SAID
ARTHUR
NONE
AT
ALL
SAID
MR
PROSSER
AND
STORMED
NERVOUSLY
OFF
WONDERING
WHY
HIS
BRAIN
WAS
FILLED
WITH
A
THOUSAND
HAIRY
HORSEMEN
ALL
SHOUTING
AT
HIM
BY
A
CURIOUS
COINCIDENCE
NONE
AT
ALL
IS
EXACTLY
HOW
MUCH
SUSPICION
THE
APE
DESCENDANT
ARTHUR
DENT
HAD
THAT
ONE
OF
HIS
CLOSEST
FRIENDS
WAS
NOT
DESCENDED
FROM
AN
APE
BUT
WAS
IN
FACT
FROM
A
SMALL
PLANET
IN
THE
VICINITY
OF
BETELGEUSE
AND
NOT
FROM
GUILDFORD
AS
HE
USUALLY
CLAIMED
ARTHUR
DENT
HAD
NEVER
EVER
SUSPECTED
THIS
THIS
FRIEND
OF
HIS
HAD
FIRST
ARRIVED
ON
THE
PLANET
SOME
FIFTEEN
EARTH
YEARS
PREVIOUSLY
AND
HE
HAD
WORKED
HARD
TO
BLEND
HIMSELF
INTO
EARTH
SOCIETY
WITH
IT
MUST
BE
SAID
SOME
SUCCESS
FOR
INSTANCE
HE
HAD
SPENT
THOSE
FIFTEEN
YEARS
PRETENDING
TO
BE
AN
OUT
OF
WORK
ACTOR
WHICH
WAS
PLAUSIBLE
ENOUGH
HE
HAD
MADE
ONE
CARELESS
BLUNDER
THOUGH
BECAUSE
HE
HAD
SKIMPED
A
BIT
ON
HIS
PREPARATORY
RESEARCH
THE
INFORMATION
HE
HAD
GATHERED
HAD
LED
HIM
TO
CHOOSE
THE
NAME
FORD
PREFECT
AS
BEING
NICELY
INCONSPICUOUS
HE
WAS
NOT
CONSPICUOUSLY
TALL
HIS
FEATURES
WERE
STRIKING
BUT
NOT
CONSPICUOUSLY
HANDSOME
HIS
HAIR
WAS
WIRY
AND
GINGERISH
AND
BRUSHED
BACKWARDS
FROM
THE
TEMPLES
HIS
SKIN
SEEMED
TO
BE
PULLED
BACKWARDS
FROM
THE
NOSE
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
VERY
SLIGHTLY
ODD
ABOUT
HIM
BUT
IT
WAS
DIFFICULT
TO
SAY
WHAT
IT
WAS
PERHAPS
IT
WAS
THAT
HIS
EYES
DIDN
T
BLINK
OFTEN
ENOUGH
AND
WHEN
YOU
TALKED
TO
HIM
FOR
ANY
LENGTH
OF
TIME
YOUR
EYES
BEGAN
INVOLUNTARILY
TO
WATER
ON
HIS
BEHALF
PERHAPS
IT
WAS
THAT
HE
SMILED
SLIGHTLY
TOO
BROADLY
AND
GAVE
PEOPLE
THE
UNNERVING
IMPRESSION
THAT
HE
WAS
ABOUT
TO
GO
FOR
THEIR
NECK
HE
STRUCK
MOST
OF
THE
FRIENDS
HE
HAD
MADE

AN
UNRULY
BOOZER

OFTEN
GATECRASH

GET
BADLY
DRUNK
AND
START
MAKING
FUN
OF
ANY
ASTROPHYSICIST
HE
COULD
FIND
TILL
HE
GOT
THROWN
OUT
SOMETIMES
HE
WOULD
GET
SEIZED
WITH
ODDLY
DISTRACTED
MOODS
AND
STARE
INTO
THE
SKY
AS
IF
HYPNOTIZED
UNTIL
SOMEONE
ASKED
HIM
WHAT
HE
WAS
DOING
THEN
HE
WOULD
START
GUILTILY
FOR
A
MOMENT
RELAX
AND
GRIN
OH
JUST
LOOKING
FOR
FLYING
SAUCERS
HE
WOULD
JOKE
AND
EVERYONE
WOULD
LAUGH
AND
ASK
HIM
WHAT
SORT
OF
FLYING
SAUCERS
HE
WAS
LOOKING
FOR
GREEN
ONES
HE
WOULD
REPLY
WITH
A
WICKED
GRIN
LAUGH
WILDLY
FOR
A
MOMENT
AND
THEN
SUDDENLY
LUNGE
FOR
THE
NEAREST
BAR

BUY
AN
ENORMOUS
ROUND
OF

FORD

ASTONISHED
TO

SO
SO
SORT
OF
WAY
I

THE
SORT
OF
THING
YOU

LIKELY
TO

FORD

T
WORTH
BOTHERING
AT
THE
MOMENT
WHAT
WITH
THE

HE
JUST
SAID
DRINK

PERFECTLY
FACTUALLY
THE

ARTHUR

THE
REST
OF

ANOTHER
WAN
SMILE
THE
REST

FROWNED
AT

A
MAN
WAVED
AT

SINKING
LOW
OVER
HIS

I
NEVER
COULD
GET
THE
HANG
OF
THURSDAYS
CHAPTER
3
ON
THIS
PARTICULAR
THURSDAY
SOMETHING
WAS
MOVING
QUIETLY
THROUGH
THE
IONOSPHERE
MANY
MILES
ABOVE
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
PLANET
SEVERAL
SOMETHINGS
IN
FACT
SEVERAL
DOZEN
HUGE
YELLOW
CHUNKY
SLABLIKE
SOMETHINGS
HUGE
AS
OFFICE
BUILDINGS
SILENT
AS
BIRDS
THEY
SOARED
WITH
EASE
BASKING
IN
ELECTROMAGNETIC
RAYS
FROM
THE
STAR
SOL
BIDING
THEIR
TIME
GROUPING
PREPARING
THE
PLANET
BENEATH
THEM
WAS
ALMOST
PERFECTLY
OBLIVIOUS
OF
THEIR
PRESENCE
WHICH
WAS
JUST
HOW
THEY
WANTED
IT
FOR
THE
MOMENT
THE
HUGE
YELLOW
SOMETHINGS
WENT
UNNOTICED
AT
GOONHILLY
THEY
PASSED
OVER
CAPE
CANAVERAL
WITHOUT
A
BLIP
WOOMERA
AND
JODRELL
BANK
LOOKED
STRAIGHT
THROUGH
THEM
WHICH
WAS
A
PITY
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
EXACTLY
THE
SORT
OF
THING
THEY
D
BEEN
LOOKING
FOR
ALL
THESE
YEARS
THE
ONLY
PLACE
THEY
REGISTERED
AT
ALL
WAS
ON
A
SMALL
BLACK
DEVICE
CALLED
A
SUB
ETHA
SENS
O
MATIC
WHICH
WINKED
AWAY
QUIETLY
TO
ITSELF
IT
NESTLED
IN
THE
DARKNESS
INSIDE
A
LEATHER
SATCHEL
WHICH
FORD
PREFECT
WORE
HABITUALLY
ROUND
HIS
NECK
THE
CONTENTS
OF
FORD
PREFECT
S
SATCHEL
WERE
QUITE
INTERESTING
IN
FACT
AND
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
ANY
EARTH
PHYSICIST
S
EYES
POP
OUT
OF
HIS
HEAD
WHICH
IS
WHY
HE
ALWAYS
CONCEALED
THEM
BY
KEEPING
A
COUPLE
OF
DOG
EARED
SCRIPTS
FOR
PLAYS
HE
PRETENDED
HE
WAS
AUDITIONING
FOR
STUFFED
IN
THE
TOP
BESIDES
THE
SUB
ETHA
SENS
O
MATIC
AND
THE
SCRIPTS
HE
HAD
AN
ELECTRONIC
THUMB
A
SHORT
SQUAT
BLACK
ROD
SMOOTH
AND
MATT
WITH
A
COUPLE
OF
FLAT
SWITCHES
AND
DIALS
AT
ONE
END
HE
ALSO
HAD
A
DEVICE
WHICH
LOOKED
RATHER
LIKE
A
LARGISH
ELECTRONIC
CALCULATOR
THIS
HAD
ABOUT
A
HUNDRED
TINY
FLAT
PRESS
BUTTONS
AND
A
SCREEN
ABOUT
FOUR
INCHES
SQUARE
ON
WHICH
ANY
ONE
OF
A
MILLION
PAGES
COULD
BE
SUMMONED
AT
A
MOMENT
S
NOTICE
IT
LOOKED
INSANELY
COMPLICATED
AND
THIS
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
WHY
THE
SNUG
PLASTIC
COVER
IT
FITTED
INTO
HAD
THE
WORDS
DON
T
PANIC
PRINTED
ON
IT
IN
LARGE
FRIENDLY
LETTERS
THE
OTHER
REASON
WAS
THAT
THIS
DEVICE
WAS
IN
FACT
THAT
MOST
REMARKABLE
OF
ALL
BOOKS
EVER
TO
COME
OUT
OF
THE
GREAT
PUBLISHING
CORPORATIONS
OF
URSA
MINOR
THE
HITCH
HIKER
S
GUIDE
TO
THE
GALAXY
THE
REASON
WHY
IT
WAS
PUBLISHED
IN
THE
FORM
OF
A
MICRO
SUB
MESON
ELECTRONIC
COMPONENT
IS
THAT
IF
IT
WERE
PRINTED
IN
NORMAL
BOOK
FORM
AN
INTERSTELLAR
HITCH
HIKER
WOULD
REQUIRE
SEVERAL
INCONVENIENTLY
LARGE
BUILDINGS
TO
CARRY
IT
AROUND
IN
BENEATH
THAT
IN
FORD
PREFECT
S
SATCHEL
WERE
A
FEW
BIROS
A
NOTEPAD
AND
A
LARGISH
BATH
TOWEL
FROM
MARKS
AND
SPENCER
THE
HITCH
HIKER
S
GUIDE
TO
THE
GALAXY
HAS
A
FEW
THINGS
TO
SAY
ON
THE
SUBJECT
OF
TOWELS
A
TOWEL
IT
SAYS
IS
ABOUT
THE
MOST
MASSIVELY
USEFUL
THING
AN
INTERSTELLAR
HITCH
HIKER
CAN
HAVE
PARTLY
IT
HAS
GREAT
PRACTICAL
VALUE
YOU
CAN
WRAP
IT
AROUND
YOU
FOR
WARMTH
AS
YOU
BOUND
ACROSS
THE
COLD
MOONS
OF
JAGLAN

YOU
CAN
LIE
ON
IT
ON
THE
BRILLIANT
MARBLE

BEACHES
OF

YOU
CAN
SLEEP
UNDER
IT
BENEATH
THE

WHICH
SHINE
SO
REDLY
ON
THE
DESERT
WORLD
OF
KAKRAFOON
USE
IT
TO
SAIL
A
MINI

DOWN
THE
SLOW
HEAVY

IT
FOR
USE
IN
HAND

HAND
COMBAT
WRAP
IT
ROUND
YOUR
HEAD
TO
WARD
OFF
NOXIOUS
FUMES
OR
TO
AVOID
THE
GAZE
OF
THE
RAVENOUS
BUGBLATTER
BEAST
OF
TRAAL
A
MINDBOGGINGLY
STUPID
ANIMAL
IT
ASSUMES
THAT
IF
YOU
CAN
T
SEE
IT
IT
CAN
T
SEE
YOU
DAFT
AS
A
BUSH
BUT
VERY
RAVENOUS
YOU
CAN
WAVE
YOUR
TOWEL
IN
EMERGENCIES
AS
A
DISTRESS
SIGNAL
AND
OF
COURSE
DRY
YOURSELF
OFF
WITH
IT
IF
IT
STILL
SEEMS
TO
BE
CLEAN
ENOUGH
MORE
IMPORTANTLY
A
TOWEL
HAS
IMMENSE
PSYCHOLOGICAL
VALUE
FOR
SOME
REASON
IF
A
STRAG
STRAG
NON
HITCH
HIKER
DISCOVERS
THAT
A
HITCH

CLICKED
HIS

IN

HE
URGED
AT
THAT
MOMENT
THE
DULL
SOUND
OF
A
RUMBLING
CRASH
FROM

FILTERED
THROUGH
THE
LOW
MURMUR
OF
THE

THROUGH

OF

THROUGH

OF

WILDLY
AROUND

MY

THEY

RE
KNOCKING
MY

DOWN
WHAT
THE

I
DOING
IN
THE

FORD
IT
HARDLY
MAKES
ANY

AT
THIS
STAGE
SAID
FORD
LET
THEM
HAVE
THEIR
FUN
FUN
YELPED
ARTHUR
FUN
HE
QUICKLY
CHECKED
OUT
OF
THE

AGAIN
THAT
THEY
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
SAME
THING
DAMN
THEIR
FUN
HE
HOOTED
AND
RAN
OUT
OF
THE
PUB
FURIOUSLY
WAVING
A
NEARLY
EMPTY
BEER
GLASS
HE
MADE
NO
FRIENDS
AT
ALL
IN
THE
PUB
THAT
LUNCHTIME
STOP
YOU
VANDALS
YOU
HOME
WRECKERS
BAWLED
ARTHUR
YOU
HALF
CRAZED
VISIGOTHS
STOP
WILL
YOU
FORD
WOULD
HAVE
TO
GO
AFTER
HIM
TURNING
QUICKLY
TO
THE
BARMAN
HE
ASKED
FOR
FOUR
PACKETS
OF
PEANUTS
THERE
YOU
ARE
SIR
SAID
THE
BARMAN
SLAPPING
THE
PACKETS
ON
THE
BAR
TWENTY
EIGHT
PENCE
IF
YOU
D
BE
SO
KIND
FORD
WAS
VERY
KIND
HE
GAVE
THE
BARMAN
ANOTHER
FIVE
POUND
NOTE
AND
TOLD
HIM
TO
KEEP
THE
CHANGE
THE
BARMAN
LOOKED
AT
IT
AND
THEN
LOOKED
AT
FORD
HE
SUDDENLY
SHIVERED
HE
EXPERIENCED
A
MOMENTARY
SENSATION
THAT
HE
DIDN
T
UNDERSTAND
BECAUSE
NO
ONE
ON
EARTH
HAD
EVER
EXPERIENCED
IT
BEFORE
IN
MOMENTS
OF
GREAT
STRESS
EVERY
LIFE
FORM
THAT
EXISTS
GIVES
OUT
A
TINY
SUBLIMAL
SIGNAL
THIS
SIGNAL
SIMPLY
COMMUNICATES
AN
EXACT
AND
ALMOST
PATHETIC
SENSE
OF
HOW
FAR
THAT
BEING
IS
FROM
THE
PLACE
OF
HIS
BIRTH
ON
EARTH
IT
IS
NEVER
POSSIBLE
TO
BE
FURTHER
THAN
SIXTEEN
THOUSAND
MILES
FROM
YOUR
BIRTHPLACE
WHICH
REALLY
ISN
T
VERY
FAR
SO
SUCH
SIGNALS
ARE
TOO
MINUTE
TO
BE
NOTICED
FORD
PREFECT
WAS
AT
THIS
MOMENT
UNDER
GREAT
STRESS
AND
HE
WAS
BORN
600
LIGHT
YEARS
AWAY
IN
THE
NEAR
VICINITY
OF
BETELGEUSE
THE
BARMAN
REELED
FOR
A
MOMENT
HIT
BY
A
SHOCKING
INCOMPREHENSIBLE
SENSE
OF
DISTANCE
HE
DIDN
T
KNOW
WHAT
IT
MEANT
BUT
HE
LOOKED
AT
FORD
PREFECT
WITH
A
NEW
SENSE
OF
RESPECT
ALMOST
AWE
ARE
YOU
SERIOUS
SIR
HE
SAID
IN
A
SMALL
WHISPER
WHICH
HAD
THE
EFFECT
OF
SILENCING
THE
PUB
YOU
THINK
THE
WORLD
S
GOING
TO
END
YES
SAID
FORD
BUT
THIS
AFTERNOON
FORD
HAD
RECOVERED
HIMSELF
HE
WAS
AT
HIS
FLIPPEST
YES
HE
SAID
GAILY
IN
LESS
THAN
TWO
MINUTES
I
WOULD
ESTIMATE
THE
BARMAN
COULDN
T
BELIEVE
THE
CONVERSATION
HE
WAS
HAVING
BUT
HE
COULDN
T
BELIEVE
THE
SENSATION
HE
HAD
JUST
HAD
EITHER
ISN
T
THERE
ANYTHING
WE
CAN
DO
ABOUT
IT
THEN
HE
SAID
NO
NOTHING
SAID
FORD
STUFFING
THE
PEANUTS
INTO
HIS
POCKETS
SOMEONE
IN
THE
HUSHED
BAR
SUDDENLY
LAUGHED
RAUCOUSLY
AT
HOW
STUPID
EVERYONE
HAD
BECOME
THE
MAN
SITTING
NEXT
TO
FORD
WAS
A
BIT
SOZZLED
BY
NOW
HIS
EYES
WAVED
THEIR
WAY
UP
TO
FORD
I
THOUGHT
HE
SAID
THAT
IF
THE
WORLD
WAS
GOING
TO
END
WE
WERE
MEANT
TO
LIE
DOWN
OR
PUT
A
PAPER
BAG
OVER
OUR
HEAD
OR
SOMETHING
IF
YOU
LIKE
YES
SAID
FORD
THAT
S
WHAT
THEY
TOLD
US
IN
THE
ARMY
SAID
THE
MAN
AND
HIS
EYES
BEGAN
THE
LONG
TREK
BACK
DOWN
TO
HIS
WHISKY
WILL
THAT
HELP
ASKED
THE
BARMAN
NO
SAID
FORD
AND
GAVE
HIM
A
FRIENDLY
SMILE
EXCUSE
ME
HE
SAID
I
VE
GOT
TO
GO
WITH
A
WAVE
HE
LEFT
THE
PUB
WAS
SILENT
FOR
A
MOMENT
LONGER
AND
THEN
EMBARRASSINGLY
ENOUGH
THE
MAN
WITH
THE
RAUCOUS
LAUGH
DID
IT
AGAIN
THE
GIRL
HE
HAD
DRAGGED
ALONG
TO
THE
PUB
WITH
HIM
HAD
GROWN
TO
LOATHE
HIM
DEARLY
OVER
THE
LAST
HOUR
OR
SO
AND
IT
WOULD
PROBABLY
HAVE
BEEN
A
GREAT
SATISFACTION
TO
HER
TO
KNOW
THAT
IN
A
MINUTE
AND
A
HALF
OR
SO
HE
WOULD
SUDDENLY
EVAPORATE
INTO
A
WHIFF
OF
HYDROGEN
OZONE
AND
CARBON
MONOXIDE
HOWEVER
WHEN
THE
MOMENT
CAME
SHE
WOULD
BE
TOO
BUSY
EVAPORATING
HERSELF
TO
NOTICE
IT
THE
BARMAN
CLEARED
HIS
THROAT
HE
HEARD
HIMSELF
SAY
LAST
ORDERS
PLEASE
THE
HUGE
YELLOW
MACHINES
BEGAN
TO
SINK
DOWNWARD
AND
TO
MOVE
FASTER
FORD

THE
WAY

THE
SUDDEN
IRRATIONAL
SQUALL

WHAT
MR

HAD
NOTICED
WAS
THAT
HUGE
YELLOW
SOMETHINGS
WERE
SCREAMING
THROUGH

IMPOSSIBLY
HUGE
YELLOW

AND
I

ARTHUR
STILL

UNTIL
I
GET

OR
I
CAN
THINK
OF

EVEN

UNPLEASANT
TO

AND
THEN
ARTHUR
TRIPPED

FELL
HEADLONG
ROLLED
AND
LANDED
FLAT
ON

AT

HE
NOTICED
THAT
SOMETHING
WAS
GOING

SHRIEKED
WHATEVER
IT
WAS

TORE
THE

APART
WITH

BUGGERING
NOISE
AND
LEAPT
OFF
INTO

LEAVING
THE

TO
SHUT

IT
WITH
A

THAT
DROVE
YOUR

SIX

INTO
YOUR

ANOTHER

FOLLOWED
AND
DID
THE

THING
ONLY
LOUDER
IT
S
DIFFICULT
TO
SAY
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE
PEOPLE
ON
THE

OF
THE

WERE
DOING
NOW
BECAUSE
THEY
DIDN

REALLY
KNOW
WHAT
THEY
WERE
DOING
THEMSELVES
NONE
OF

MADE
A

RUNNING
INTO

NOISELESSLY
AT

ALL
AROUND
THE

CITY

EXPLODED
WITH

SLEWED
INTO

FELL
ON

AND
THEN
ROLLED
OFF
LIKE
A

OVER

AND
VALLEYS
DESERTS
AND

SEEMING
TO
FLATTEN
EVERYTHING
IT
HIT
ONLY

STOOD

STOOD
WITH
TERRIBLE

IN
HIS

DECIPHERED
THE

SITTING
ALONE
IN

A
COLDNESS
HAD
GRIPPED
HIM
AND
SQUEEZED
HIS

IN

OF
THE

WHO
COULD
HAVE
COME
AND
SAID
A

SCREAMED
THROUGH

IT
WAS

A
FAIT

WAS
THE

WAS
WHY

IT
HE
BANKED

AT

WAS
ALL
ABOUT
TODAY
WAS
ALSO
HIS
TWO

BUT
THAT
WAS
JUST
ANOTHER
MEANINGLESS
COINCIDENCE
AS
HE
SKIPPED
HIS
BOAT
ACROSS
THE
SEAS
OF
DAMOGRAN
HE
SMILED
QUIETLY
TO
HIMSELF
ABOUT
WHAT
A
WONDERFUL
EXCITING
DAY
IT
WAS
GOING
TO
BE
HE
RELAXED
AND
SPREAD
HIS

YOU

WAS
ABOUT
TWENTY

LONG
FIVE

ACROSS

SHAPED
IN

IT

RIGHT
AS
SIMPLY
A
MEANS
OF
DEFINING
THE
SWEEP
AND
CURVE
OF

THIS

WAS

BY
THE

THAT
THE

CONSISTED
ALMOST
ENTIRELY
OF

FROM

OF

THE

SEEMED
TO
BE
TO

A

WITH

ROUND

AN

WAS

TRADITIONALLY
WORE

THE

OF

HE

FOR

THEN
RAISED
HIS

IN

HI
HE
SAID
A

SIDLED
UP

ATTEMPTED
TO

FLOATING

SOME
FIVE

OUT
FROM

HAD
BEEN

BY
A

FROND
CRESTED
EAGLE
AND
HAD
ALREADY
BECOME
INCORPORATED
INTO
AN
EXTRAORDINARY
NEW
FORM
OF

WHICH
THE

HAD
INVENTED
IT
WAS
CONSTRUCTED
LARGELY
OF

AND
IT
WAS
VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
A
NEWLY
HATCHED
BABY
EAGLE
TO
BREAK
OUT
OF
IT
THE
DAMOGRAN
FROND
CRESTED
EAGLE
HAD
HEARD

OF

BUT
WANTED
NO

WITH

ZAPHOD
BEEBLEBROX
WOULD
NOT
BE

HIS

AND
HE
GENTLY
DEFLECTED
THE

BEING
OFFERED
HIM
BY
THE

HI
HE
SAID
AGAIN
EVERYONE
BEAMED
AT
HIM
OR
AT

NEARLY
EVERYONE
HE
SINGLED
OUT
TRILLIAN
FROM
THE
CROWD
TRILLIAN
WAS
A
GIRD
THAT
ZAPHOD
HAD
PICKED
UP
RECENTLY
WHILST
VISITING
A
PLANET
JUST
FOR
FUN
INCOGNITO
SHE
WAS
SLIM
DARKISH
HUMANOID
WITH
LONG
WAVES
OF
BLACK
HAIR
A
FULL
MOUTH
AN
ODD
LITTLE
NOB
OF
A
NOSE
AND
RIDICULOUSLY
BROWN
EYES
WITH
HER
RED
HEAD
SCARF
KNOTTED
IN
THAT
PARTICULAR
WAY
AND
HER
LONG
FLOWING
SILKY
BROWN
DRESS
SHE
LOOKED
VAGUELY
ARABIC
NOT
THAT
ANYONE
THERE
HAD
EVER
HEARD
OF
AN
ARAB
OF
COURSE
THE
ARABS
HAD
VERY
RECENTLY
CEASED
TO
EXIST
AND
EVEN
WHEN
THEY
HAD
EXISTED
THEY
WERE
FIVE
HUNDRED
THOUSAND
LIGHT
YEARS
FROM
DAMOGRAN
TRILLIAN
WASN
T
ANYBODY
IN
PARTICULAR
OR
SO
ZAPHOD
CLAIMED
SHE
JUST
WENT
AROUND
WITH
HIM
RATHER
A
LOT
AND
TOLD
HIM
WHAT
SHE
THOUGHT
OF
HIM
HI
HONEY
HE
SAID
TO
HER
SHE
FLASHED
HIM
A
QUICK
TIGHT
SMILE
AND
LOOKED
AWAY
THEN
SHE
LOOKED
BACK
FOR
A
MOMENT
AND
SMILED
MORE
WARMLY
BUT
BY
THIS
TIME
HE
WAS
LOOKING
AT
SOMETHING
ELSE
HI
HE
SAID
TO
A
SMALL
KNOT
OF
CREATURES
FROM
THE
PRESS
WHO
WERE
STANDING
NEARBY
WISHING
THAT
HE
WOULD
STOP
SAYING
HI
AND
GET
ON
WITH
THE
QUOTES
HE
GRINNED
AT
THEM
PARTICULARLY
BECAUSE
HE
KNEW
THAT
IN
A
FEW
MOMENTS
HE
WOULD
BE
GIVING
THEM
ONE
HELL
OF
A
QUOTE
THE
NEXT
THING
HE
SAID
THOUGH
WAS
NOT
A
LOT
OF
USE
TO
THEM
ONE
OF
THE
OFFICIALS
OF
THE
PARTY
HAD
IRRITABLY
DECIDED
THAT
THE
PRESIDENT
WAS
CLEARLY
NOT
IN
A
MOOD
TO
READ
THE
DELICIOUSLY
TURNED
SPEECH
THAT
HAD
BEEN
WRITTEN
FOR
HIM
AND
HAD
FLIPPED
THE
SWITCH
ON
THE
REMOTE
CONTROL
DEVICE
IN
HIS
POCKET
AWAY
IN
FRONT
OF
THEM
A
HUGE
WHITE
DOME
THAT
BULGED
AGAINST
THE
SKY
CRACKED
DOWN
IN
THE
MIDDLE
SPLIT
AND
SLOWLY
FOLDED
ITSELF
DOWN
INTO
THE
GROUND
EVERYONE
GASPED
ALTHOUGH
THEY
HAD
KNOWN
PERFECTLY
WELL
IT
WAS
GOING
TO
DO
THAT
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
BUILT
IT
THAT
WAY
BENEATH
IT
LAY
UNCOVERED
A
HUGE
STARSHIP
ONE
HUNDRED
AND
FIFTY
METRES
LONG
SHAPED
LIKE
A
SLEEK
RUNNING
SHOE
PERFECTLY
WHITE
AND
MINDBOGGINGLY
BEAUTIFUL
AT
THE
HEART
OF
IT
UNSEEN
LAY
A
SMALL
GOLD
BOX
WHICH
CARRIED
WITHIN
IT
THE
MOST
BRAIN
WRETCHING
DEVICE
EVER
CONCEIVED
A
DEVICE
WHICH
MADE
THIS
STARSHIP
UNIQUE
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
GALAXY
A
DEVICE
AFTER
WHICH
THE

HAD
BEEN
NAMED
THE
HEART
OF
GOLD
WOW
SAID
ZAPHOD
BEEBLEBROX
TO
THE
HEART
OF
GOLD
THERE
WASN
T
MUCH
ELSE
HE
COULD
SAY
HE
SAID
IT
AGAIN
BECAUSE
HE
KNEW
IT
WOULD
ANNOY
THE
PRESS
WOW
THE
CROWD
TURNED
THEIR
FACES
BACK
TOWARDS
HIM
EXPECTANTLY
HE
WINKED
AT
TRILLIAN
WHO
RAISED
HER
EYEBROWS
AND
WIDENED
HER
EYES
AT
HIM
SHE
KNEW
WHAT
HE
WAS
ABOUT
TO
SAY
AND
THOUGHT
HIM
A
TERRIBLE
SHOWOFF
THAT
IS
REALLY
AMAZING
HE
SAID
THAT
REALLY
IS
TRULY
AMAZING
THAT
IS
SO
AMAZINGLY
AMAZING
I
THINK
I
D
LIKE
TO
STEAL
IT
A
MARVELLOUS
PRESIDENTIAL
QUOTE
ABSOLUTELY
TRUE
TO
FORM
THE
CROWD
LAUGHED
APPRECIATIVELY
THE
NEWSMEN
GLEEFULLY
PUNCHED
BUTTONS
ON
THEIR
SUB
ETHA
NEWS
MATICS
AND
THE
PRESIDENT
GRINNED
AS
HE
GRINNED
HIS
HEART
SCREAMED
UNBEARABLY
AND
HE
FINGERED
THE
SMALL
PARALYSO
MATIC
BOMB
THAT
NESTLED
QUIETLY
IN
HIS
POCKET
FINALLY
HE
COULD
BEAR
IT
NO
MORE
HE
LIFTED
HIS
HEADS
UP
TO
THE
SKY
LET
OUT
A
WILD
WHOOP
IN
MAJOR
THIRDS
THREW
THE
BOMB
TO
THE
GROUND
AND
RAN
FORWARD
THROUGH
THE
SEA
OF
SUDDENLY
FROZEN
SMILES
CHAPTER
5
PROSTETNIC
VOGON
JELTZ
WAS
NOT
A
PLEASANT
SIGHT
EVEN
FOR
OTHER
VOGONS
HIS
HIGHLY
DOMED
NOSE
ROSE
HIGH
ABOVE
A
SMALL
PIGGY
FOREHEAD
HIS
DARK
GREEN
RUBBERY
SKIN
WAS
THICK
ENOUGH
FOR
HIM
TO
PLAY
THE
GAME
OF
VOGON
CIVIL
SERVICE
POLITICS
AND
PLAY
IT
WELL
AND
WATERPROOF
ENOUGH
FOR
HIM
TO
SURVIVE
INDEFINITELY
AT
SEA
DEPTHS
OF
UP
TO
A
THOUSAND
FEET
WITH
NO
ILL
EFFECTS
NOT
THAT
HE
EVER
WENT
SWIMMING
OF
COURSE
HIS
BUSY
SCHEDULE
WOULD
NOT
ALLOW
IT
HE
WAS
THE
WAY
HE
WAS
BECAUSE
BILLIONS
OF
YEARS
AGO
WHEN
THE
VOGONS
HAD
FIRST
CRAWLED
OUT
OF
THE
SLUGGISH
PRIMEVAL
SEAS
OF
VOGSPHERE
AND
HAD
LAIN
PANTING
AND
HEAVING
ON
THE
PLANET
S
VIRGIN
SHORES
WHEN
THE
FIRST
RAYS
OF
THE
BRIGHT
YOUNG
VOGSOL
SUN
HAD
SHONE
ACROSS
THEM
THAT
MORNING
IT
WAS
AS
IF
THE
FORCES
OF
EVOLUTION
AD
SIMPLY
GIVEN
UP
ON
THEM
THERE
AND
THEN
HAD
TURNED
ASIDE
IN
DISGUST
AND
WRITTEN
THEM
OFF
AS
AN
UGLY
AND
UNFORTUNATE
MISTAKE
THEY
NEVER
EVOLVED
AGAIN
THEY
SHOULD
NEVER
HAVE
SURVIVED
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
DID
IS
SOME
KIND
OF
TRIBUTE
TO
THE
THICK
WILLED
SLUG
BRAINED
STUBBORNNESS
OF
THESE
CREATURES
EVOLUTION
THEY
SAID
TO
THEMSELVES
WHO
NEEDS
IT
AND
WHAT
NATURE
REFUSED
TO
DO
FOR
THEM
THEY
SIMPLY
DID
WITHOUT
UNTIL
SUCH
TIME
AS
THEY
WERE
ABLE
TO
RECTIFY
THE
GROSSER
ANATOMICAL
INCONVENIENCES
WITH
SURGERY
MEANWHILE
THE
NATURAL
FORCES
ON
THE
PLANET
VOGSPHERE
HAD
BEEN
WORKING
OVERTIME
TO
MAKE
UP
FOR
THEIR
EARLIER
BLUNDER
THEY
BROUGHT
FORTH
SCINTILLATING
JEWELLED
SCUTTLING
CRABS
WHICH
THE
VOGONS
ATE
SMASHING
THEIR
SHELLS
WITH
IRON
MALLETS
TALL
ASPIRING
TREES
WITH
BREATHTAKING
SLENDERNESS
AND
COLOUR
WHICH
THE
VOGONS
CUT
DOWN
AND
BURNED
THE
CRAB
MEAT
WITH
ELEGANT
GAZELLE
LIKE
CREATURES
WITH
SILKEN
COATS
AND
DEWY
EYES
WHICH
THE
VOGONS
WOULD
CATCH
AND
SIT
ON
THEY
WERE
NO
USE
AS
TRANSPORT
BECAUSE
THEIR
BACKS
WOULD
SNAP
INSTANTLY
BUT
THE
VOGONS
SAT
ON
THEM
ANYWAY
THUS
THE
PLANET
VOGSPHERE
WHILED
AWAY
THE
UNHAPPY
MILLENNIA
UNTIL
THE
VOGONS
SUDDENLY
DISCOVERED
THE
PRINCIPLES
OF
INTERSTELLAR
TRAVEL
WITHIN
A
FEW
SHORT
VOG
YEARS
EVERY
LAST
VOGON
HAD
MIGRATED
TO
THE
MEGABRANTIS
CLUSTER
THE
POLITICAL
HUB
OF
THE
GALAXY
AND
NOW
FORMED
THE
IMMENSELY
POWERFUL
BACKBONE
OF
THE
GALACTIC
CIVIL
SERVICE
THEY
HAVE
ATTEMPTED
TO
ACQUIRE
LEARNING
THEY
HAVE
ATTEMPTED
TO
ACQUIRE
STYLE
AND
SOCIAL
GRACE
BUT
IN
MOST
RESPECTS
THE
MODERN
VOGON
IS
LITTLE
DIFFERENT
FROM
HIS
PRIMITIVE
FOREBEARS
EVERY
YEAR
THEY
IMPORT
TWENTY
SEVEN
THOUSAND
SCINTILLATING
JEWELLED
SCUTTLING
CRABS
FROM
THEIR
NATIVE
PLANET
AND
WHILE
AWAY
A
HAPPY
DRUNKEN
NIGHT
SMASHING
THEM
TO
BITS
WITH
IRON
MALLETS
PROSTETNIC
VOGON
JELTZ
WAS
A
FAIRLY
TYPICAL
VOGON
IN
THAT
HE
WAS
THOROUGHLY
VILE
ALSO
HE
DID
NOT
LIKE
HITCH
HIKERS
SOMEWHERE
IN
A
SMALL
DARK
CABIN
BURIED
DEEP
IN
THE
INTESTINES
OF
PROSTETNIC
VOGON
JELTZ
S
FLAGSHIP
A
SMALL
MATCH
FLARED
NERVOUSLY
THE
OWNER
OF
THE
MATCH
WAS
NOT
A
VOGON
BUT
HE
KNEW
ALL
ABOUT
THEM
AND
WAS
RIGHT
TO
BE
NERVOUS
HIS
NAME
WAS
FORD
PREFECT
HE
LOOKED
ABOUT
THE
CABIN
BUT
COULD
SEE
VERY
LITTLE
STRANGE
MONSTROUS
SHADOWS
LOOMED
AND
LEAPED
WITH
THE
TINY
FLICKERING
FLAME
BUT
ALL
WAS
QUIET
HE
BREATHED
A
SILENT
THANK
YOU
TO
THE
DENTRASSIS
THE
DENTRASSIS
ARE
AN
UNRULY
TRIBE
OF
GOURMANDS
A
WILD
BUT
PLEASANT
BUNCH
WHOM
THE
VOGONS
HAD
RECENTLY
TAKEN
TO
EMPLOYING
AS
CATERING
STAFF
ON
THEIR
LONG
HAUL
FLEETS
ON
THE
STRICT
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
THEY
KEEP
THEMSELVES
VERY
MUCH
TO
THEMSELVES
THIS
SUITED
THE
DENTRASSIS
FINE
BECAUSE
THEY
LOVED
VOGON
MONEY
WHICH
IS
ONE
OF
THE
HARDEST
CURRENCIES
IN
SPACE
BUT
LOATHED
THE
VOGONS
THEMSELVES
THE
ONLY
SORT
OF
VOGON
A
DENTRASSI
LIKED
TO
SEE
WAS
AN
ANNOYED
VOGON
IT
WAS
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
TINY
PIECE
OF
INFORMATION
THAT
FORD
PREFECT
WAS
NOT
NOW
A
WHIFF
OF
HYDROGEN
OZONE
AND
CARBON
MONOXIDE
HE
HEARD
A
SLIGHT
GROAN
BY
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
MATCH
HE
SAW
A
HEAVY
SHAPE
MOVING
SLIGHTLY
ON
THE
FLOOR
QUICKLY
HE
SHOOK
THE
MATCH
OUT
REACHED
IN
HIS
POCKET
FOUND
WHAT
HE
WAS
LOOKING
FOR
AND
TOOK
IT
OUT
HE
CROUCHED
ON
THE

ARTHUR
DENT
DARK
NO

ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
FORD
PREFECT
HAD
ALWAYS
FOUND
HARDEST
TO
UNDERSTAND
ABOUT
HUMAN
BEINGS
WAS
THEIR
HABIT
OF
CONTINUALLY
STATING
AND
REPEATING
THE
OBVIOUS
AS
IN
IT
S
A
NICE
DAY
OR
YOU
RE

TALL
OR
OH

YOU
SEEM
TO
HAVE
FALLEN
DOWN
A
THIRTY
FOOT
WELL
ARE
YOU
ALRIGHT
AT
FIRST
FORD
HAD
FORMED
A
THEORY
TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
THIS
STRANGE
BEHAVIOUR
IF
HUMAN
BEINGS
DON
T
KEEP
EXERCISING
THEIR
LIPS
HE
THOUGHT
THEIR
MOUTHS
PROBABLY
SEIZE
UP
AFTER
A
FEW
MONTHS
CONSIDERATION
AND
OBSERVATION
HE
ABANDONED
THIS
THEORY
IN
FAVOUR
OF
A
NEW
ONE
IF
THEY
DON
T
KEEP
ON
EXERCISING
THEIR
LIPS
HE
THOUGHT
THEIR
BRAINS
START
WORKING
AFTER
A
WHILE
HE
ABANDONED
THIS
ONE
AS
WELL
AS
BEING
OBSTRUCTIVELY
CYNICAL
AND
DECIDED
HE
QUITE
LIKED
HUMAN
BEINGS
AFTER
ALL
BUT
HE
ALWAYS
REMAINED
DESPERATELY
WORRIED
ABOUT
THE
TERRIBLE
NUMBER

GREEN

ROUND
THE

HE
ALWAYS
FELT
VAGUELY
IRRITABLE
AFTER
DEMOLISHING
POPULATED

HE
WISHED
THAT
SOMEONE
WOULD
COME
AND
TELL
HIM
THAT
IT
WAS
ALL
WRONG
SO
THAT
HE
COULD
SHOUT
AT
THEM
AND
FEEL
BETTER
HE
FLOPPED
AS
HEAVILY
AS
HE
COULD
ON
TO
HIS
CONTROL
SEAT
IN
THE
HOPE
THAT
IT
WOULD
BREAK
AND
GIVE
HIM
SOMETHING
TO
BE
GENUINELY
ANGRY
ABOUT

IT
ONLY
GAVE
A
COMPLAINING

OF
CREAK
GO
AWAY
HE
SHOUTED
AT
A

GUARD
WHO
ENTERED
THE

AT
THAT

VANISHED
IMMEDIATELY
FEELING
RATHER
RELIEVED
HE
WAS
GLAD
IT
WOULDN
T
NOW
BE
HIM
WHO
DELIVERED
THE
REPORT
THEY
D
JUST
RECEIVED
THE
REPORT
WAS
AN
OFFICIAL
RELEASE
WHICH
SAID
THAT
A
WONDERFUL
NEW
FORM
OF
SPACESHIP
DRIVE
WAS
AT
THIS
MOMENT
BEING
UNVEILED
AT
A
GOVERNMENT
RESEARCH
BASE
ON

WHICH
WOULD
HENCEFORTH
MAKE
ALL
HYPERSPATIAL

UNNECESSARY
ANOTHER
DOOR
SLID
OPEN
BUT
THIS
TIME
THE
VOGON
CAPTAIN
DIDN

SHOUT
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
THE
DOOR
FROM
THE
GALLEY
QUARTERS
WHERE
THE
DENTRASSIS
PREPARED

A

WOULD
BE
MOST
WELCOME
A
HUGE

TRAY
IT
WAS
GRINNING
LIKE
A

JELTZ
WAS
DELIGHTED
HE
KNEW
THAT
WHEN
A
DENTRASSI
LOOKED
THAT
PLEASED
WITH

THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
GOING
ON
SOMEWHERE
ON
THE

THAT
HE
COULD

VERY
ANGRY

FISH
WRIGGLING
AROUND

SUDDENLY
A

THE
SUDDEN
SICKENING
SENSATION
OF
THE

SLITHERING
DEEP
INTO
HIS
AURAL
TRACT
GASPING
WITH
HORROR
HE
SCRABBLED
AT

FOR
A
SECOND
OR
SO
BUT
THEN
SLOWLY
TURNED

EYED
WITH
WONDER
HE
WAS
EXPERIENCING
THE
AURAL
EQUIVALENT
OF
LOOKING
AT
A
PICTURE
OF
TWO
BLACK
SILHOUETTED
FACES
AND
SUDDENLY
SEEING
IT
AS
A
PICTURE
OF
A
WHITE
CANDLESTICK
OR
OF
LOOKING
AT
A
LOT
OF
COLOURED
DOTS
ON
A

HARD
TO
GET
WHERE
I
AM
TODAY
AND
I
DIDN

SIMPLY
SO
I
COULD

IT
INTO
A
TAXI
SERVICE
FOR
A

OF
DEGENERATE
FREELOADERS
I
HAVE
SENT
OUT
A
SEARCH
PARTY

FOR
A
SEVENTY
TWO
HOUR
REFIT
AND
NO

THE

DURING
THAT
TIME
I
REPEAT
ALL

LEAVE
IS
CANCELLED
I
VE
JUST
HAD
AN
UNHAPPY
LOVE
AFFAIR
SO
I
DON

WHY
ANYBODY

A
GOOD

MESSAGE
ENDS
THE
NOISE
STOPPED
ARTHUR
DISCOVERED
TO
HIS
EMBARRASSMENT
THAT
HE
WAS

CURLED
UP
IN
A
SMALL
BALL
ON
THE

WITH
HIS
ARMS
WRAPPED
ROUND
HIS

HE

NO

HE
ADDED
AS
ARTHUR
BEGAN
TO
UNCURL
HIMSELF
YOU
D
BETTER
BE
PREPARED
FOR
THE
JUMP
INTO
HYPERSPACE
IT
S
UNPLEASANTLY
LIKE
BEING
DRUNK
WHAT
S
SO
UNPLEASANT
ABOUT
BEING
DRUNK
YOU
ASK
A
GLASS
OF
WATER
ARTHUR
THOUGHT
ABOUT
THIS
FORD
HE
SAID
YEAH
WHAT
S
THIS
FISH
DOING
IN
MY
EAR
IT
S
TRANSLATING
FOR
YOU
IT
S
A
BABEL
FISH
LOOK
IT
UP
IN
THE
BOOK
IF
YOU
LIKE
HE
TOSSED
OVER
THE
HITCH
HIKER

TO
THE
GALAXY
AND
THEN
CURLED
HIMSELF
UP
INTO
A
FOETAL
BALL
TO
PREPARE
HIMSELF
FOR
THE

AT
THAT
MOMENT
THE
BOTTOM
FELL
OUT
OF
ARTHUR

HIS

TURNED
INSIDE
OUT
HIS

BEGAN
TO
LEAK
OUT
OF
THE
TOP
OF
HIS

FOLDED
FLAT
ABOUT
HIM
SPUN
AROUND
SHIFTED
OUT
OF

AND
LEFT
HIM
SLIDING
INTO
HIS
OWN
NAVEL
THEY
WERE
PASSING
THROUGH

THE
BABEL

SAID
THE
HITCH
HIKER
S
GUIDE
TO
THE
GALAXY
QUIETLY
IS
SMALL
YELLOW
AND
LEECH
LIKE
AND
PROBABLY
THE
ODDEST
THING
IN
THE
UNIVERSE
IT
FEEDS
ON
BRAINWAVE
ENERGY
NOT
FROM
ITS
CARRIER
BUT
FROM
THOSE
AROUND
IT
IT
ABSORBS
ALL
UNCONSCIOUS
MENTAL
FREQUENCIES
FROM
THIS
BRAINWAVE
ENERGY
TO
NOURISH
ITSELF
WITH
IT
THEN
EXCRETES
INTO
THE
MIND
OF
ITS
CARRIER
A
TELEPATHIC
MATRIX
FORMED
BY
COMBINING
THE
CONSCIOUS
THOUGHT
FREQUENCIES
WITH
NERVE
SIGNALS
PICKED
UP
FROM
THE
SPEECH
CENTRES
OF
THE
BRAIN
WHICH
HAS
SUPPLIED
THEM
THE
PRACTICAL
UPSHOT
OF
ALL
THIS
IS
THAT
IF
YOU
STICK
A
BABEL
FISH
IN
YOUR
EAR
YOU
CAN
INSTANTLY
UNDERSTAND
ANYTHING
SAID
TO
YOU
IN
ANY
FORM
OF
LANGUAGE
THE
SPEECH
PATTERNS
YOU
ACTUALLY
HEAR
DECODE
THE
BRAINWAVE
MATRIX
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
FED
INTO
YOUR
MIND
BY
YOUR
BABEL
FISH
NOW
IT
IS
SUCH
A
BIZARRELY
IMPROBABLE
COINCIDENCE
THAT
ANYTHING
SO
MINDBOGGINGLY
USEFUL
COULD
HAVE
EVOLVED
PURELY
BY
CHANCE
THAT
SOME
THINKERS
HAVE
CHOSEN
TO
SEE
IT
AS
THE
FINAL
AND
CLINCHING
PROOF
OF
THE
NON
EXISTENCE
OF
GOD
THE
ARGUMENT
GOES
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
I
REFUSE
TO
PROVE
THAT
I
EXIST
SAYS
GOD
FOR
PROOF
DENIES
FAITH
AND
WITHOUT
FAITH
I
AM
NOTHING
BUT
SAYS
MAN
THE
BABEL
FISH
IS
A
DEAD
GIVEAWAY
ISN
T
IT
IT
COULD
NOT
HAVE
EVOLVED
BY
CHANCE
IT
PROVES
YOU
EXIST
AND
SO
THEREFORE
BY
YOUR
OWN
ARGUMENTS
YOU
DON
T
QED
OH
DEAR
SAYS
GOD
I
HADN
T
THOUGHT
OF
THAT
AND
PROMPTLY
VANISHED
IN
A
PUFF
OF
LOGIC
OH
THAT
WAS
EASY
SAYS
MAN
AND
FOR
AN
ENCORE
GOES
ON
TO
PROVE
THAT
BLACK
IS
WHITE
AND
GETS
HIMSELF
KILLED
ON
THE
NEXT
ZEBRA
CROSSING
MOST
LEADING
THEOLOGIANS
CLAIM
THAT
THIS

THE

THEREFORE
NO

HE
WHIRRED
IN
CONSIDERABLE
ASTONISHMENT
OH

WAS
REALLY
PARTICULARLY
EFFECTIVE
FORD
CONTINUED
TO
STARE
AT
HIM
SLOWLY
ORGANIZING
HIS

AROUND
THIS
TOTALLY
NEW

WERE
THEY
REALLY
GOING

BE
ABLE
TO
BAREFACE
THEIR
WAY
OUT
OF

YES
DO
CONTINUE
INVITED
THE

INTERESTING
RHYTHMIC

SEEMED
TO
COUNTERPOINT
THE
ER

WITH
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
DICHOTOMIES
OF

A
THOUGHT
STRUCK
HIM
DO
YOU
REALLY

THIS
SORT
OF
THING
HE
ASKED
SUDDENLY
THE

STUPIDITY
SEEPED
SLOWLY
OVER
HIS

HE
BOOMED
WHAT

GIVE
YOU
A
FULL
SATISFYING
LIFE
STOMPING
AROUND

PUSHING
PEOPLE
OUT
OF

THE
VOGON
STARED
UP
AT
THE
LOW
STEEL
CEILING
AND
HIS
EYEBROWS
ALMOST
ROLLED
OVER
EACH
OTHER
HIS
MOUTH
SLACKED
FINALLY
HE
SAID
WELL
THE

THEY
D
HAVE
TO
BE
AGREED
FORD
ARTHUR
TWISTED
HIS
HEAD
TO
LOOK
AT

FORD
WHAT

HE
ASKED
IN
AN
AMAZED
WHISPER
OH
JUST
TRYING
TO
TAKE
AN
INTEREST
IN
THE
WORLD
AROUND
ME
OK
HE
SAID
SO
THE
HOURS
ARE
PRETTY
GOOD
THEN
HE
RESUMED
THE
VOGON
STARED
DOWN
AT
HIM
AS
SLUGGISH
THOUGHTS
MOILED
AROUND
IN
THE
MURKY
DEPTHS
YEAH
HE
SAID
BUT
NOW
YOU
COME
TO
MENTION
IT
MOST
OF
THE
ACTUAL
MINUTES
ARE
PRETTY
LOUSY
EXCEPT
HE
THOUGHT
AGAIN
WHICH
REQUIRED
LOOKING
AT
THE
CEILING
EXCEPT
SOME
OF
THE
SHOUTING
I
QUITE
LIKE
HE
FILLED
HIS
LUNGS
AND
BELLOWED
RESISTANCE
IS
SURE
YES
INTERRUPTED
FORD
HURRIEDLY
YOU
RE
GOOD
AT
THAT
I
CAN
TELL
BUT
IF
IT
S
MOSTLY
LOUSY
HE
SAID
SLOWLY
GIVING
THE
WORDS
TIME
TO
REACH
THEIR
MARK
THEN
WHY
DO
YOU
DO
IT
WHAT
IS
IT
THE
GIRLS
THE
LEATHER
THE
MACHISMO
OR
DO
YOU
JUST
FIND
THAT
COMING
TO
TERMS
WITH
THE
MINDLESS
TEDIUM
OF
IT
ALL
PRESENTS
AN
INTERESTING
CHALLENGE
ER
SAID
THE
GUARD
ER
ER
I
DUNNO
I
THINK
I
JUST
SORT
OF
DO
IT
REALLY
MY
AUNT
SAID
THAT
SPACESHIP
GUARD
WAS
A
GOOD
CAREER
FOR
A
YOUNG
VOGON
YOU
KNOW
THE
UNIFORM
THE
LOW
SLUNG
STUN
RAY
HOLSTER
THE
MINDLESS
TEDIUM
THERE
YOU
ARE
ARTHUR
SAID
FORD
WITH
THE
AIR
OF
SOMEONE
REACHING
THE
CONCLUSION
OF
HIS
ARGUMENT
YOU
THINK
YOU
VE
GOT
PROBLEMS
ARTHUR
RATHER
THOUGHT
HE
HAD
APART
FROM
THE
UNPLEASANT
BUSINESS
WITH
HIS
HOME
PLANET
THE
VOGON
GUARD
HAD
HALF
THROTTLED
HIM
ALREADY
AND
HE
DIDN
T
LIKE
THE
SOUND
OF
BEING
THROWN
INTO
SPACE
VERY
MUCH
TRY
AND
UNDERSTAND
HIS
PROBLEM
INSISTED
FORD
HERE
HE
IS
POOR
LAD
HIS
ENTIRE
LIFE
S
WORK
IS
STAMPING
AROUND
THROWING
PEOPLE
OFF
SPACESHIPS
AND
SHOUTING
ADDED
THE
GUARD
AND
SHOUTING
SURE
SAID
FORD
PATTING
THE
BLUBBERY
ARM
CLAMPED
ROUND
HIS
NECK
IN
FRIENDLY
CONDESCENSION
AND
HE
DOESN
T
EVEN
KNOW
WHY
HE
S
DOING
IT
ARTHUR
AGREED
THIS
WAS
VERY
SAD
HE
DID
THIS
WITH
A
SMALL
FEEBLE
GESTURE
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
TOO
ASPHYXICATED
TO
SPEAK
DEEP
RUMBLINGS
OF
BEMUSEMENT
CAME
FROM
THE
GUARD
WELL
NOW
YOU
PUT
IT
LIKE
THAT
I
SUPPOSE
GOOD
LAD
ENCOURAGED
FORD
BUT
ALRIGHT
WENT
ON
THE
RUMBLINGS
SO
WHAT
S
THE
ALTERNATIVE
WELL
SAID
FORD
BRIGHTLY
BUT
SLOWLY
STOP
DOING
IT
OF
COURSE
TELL
THEM
HE
WENT
ON
YOU
RE
NOT
GOING
TO
DO
IT
ANYMORE
HE
FELT
HE
HAD
TO
ADD
SOMETHING
TO
THAT
BUT
FOR
THE
MOMENT
THE
GUARD
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
HIS
MIND
OCCUPIED
PONDERING
THAT
MUCH
EERRRRRRMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
SAID
THE
GUARD
ERM
WELL
THAT
DOESN
T
SOUND
THAT
GREAT
TO
ME
FORD
SUDDENLY
FELT
THE
MOMENT
SLIPPING
AWAY
NOW
WAIT
A
MINUTE
HE
SAID
THAT
S
JUST
THE
START
YOU
SEE
THERE
S
MORE
TO
IT
THAN
THAT
YOU
SEE
BUT
AT
THAT
MOMENT
THE
GUARD
RENEWED
HIS
GRIP
AND
CONTINUED
HIS
ORIGINAL
PURPOSE
OF
LUGGING
HIS
PRISONERS
TO
THE
AIRLOCK
HE
WAS
OBVIOUSLY
QUITE
TOUCHED
NO
I
THINK
IF
IT
S
ALL
THE
SAME
TO
YOU
HE
SAID
I
D
BETTER
GET
YOU
BOTH
SHOVED
INTO
THIS
AIRLOCK
AND
THEN
GO
AND
GET
ON
WITH
SOME
OTHER
BITS
OF
SHOUTING
I
VE
GOT
TO
DO
IT
WASN
T
ALL
THE
SAME
TO
FORD
PREFECT
AFTER
ALL
COME
ON
NOW
BUT
LOOK
HE
SAID
LESS
SLOWLY
LESS
BRIGHTLY
HUHHHHGGGGGGGNNNNNNN
SAID
ARTHUR
WITHOUT
ANY
CLEAR
INFLECTION
BUT
HANG
ON
PURSUED
FORD
THERE

ABOUT
YET
ARRRGGGHHH
RESISTANCE
IS
USELESS
BELLOWED
THE
GUARD
AND
THEN
ADDED
YOU
SEE
IF
I
KEEP
IT
UP
I
CAN
EVENTUALLY
GET
PROMOTED
TO
SENIOR
SHOUTING
OFFICER
AND
THERE
AREN
T
USUALLY
MANY
VACANCIES
FOR
NON
SHOUTING
AND
NON
PUSHING
PEOPLE
ABOUT
OFFICERS
SO
I
THINK
I
D
BETTER
STICK
TO
WHAT
I
KNOW
THEY
HAD
NOW
REACHED
THE
AIRLOCK
A
LARGE
CIRCULAR
STEEL
HATCHWAY
OF
MASSIVE
STRENGTH
AND
WEIGHT
LET
INTO
THE
INNER
SKIN
OF
THE
CRAFT
THE
GUARD
OPERATED
A
CONTROL
AND
THE
HATCHWAY
SWUNG
SMOOTHLY
OPEN
BUT
THANKS
FOR
TAKING
AN
INTEREST
SAID
THE
VOGON
GUARD
BYE
NOW
HE
FLUNG
FORD
AND
ARTHUR
THROUGH
THE
HATCHWAY
INTO
THE
SMALL
CHAMBER
WITHIN
ARTHUR
LAY
PANTING
FOR
BREATH
FORD
SCRAMBLED
ROUND
AND
FLUNG
HIS
SHOULDER
USELESSLY
AGAINST
THE
RECLOSING
HATCHWAY
BUT
LISTEN
HE
SHOUTED
TO
THE
GUARD
THERE
S
A
WHOLE
WORLD
YOU
DON
T
KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT
HERE
HOW
ABOUT
THIS
DESPERATELY
HE
GRABBED
FOR
THE
ONLY
BIT
OF
CULTURE
HE
KNEW
OFFHAND
HE
HUMMED
THE
FIRST
BAR
OF
BEETHOVEN
S
FIFTH
DA
DA
DA
DUM
DOESN
T
THAT
STIR
ANYTHING
IN
YOU
NO
SAID
THE
GUARD
NOT
REALLY
BUT
I
LL
MENTION
IT
TO
MY
AUNT
IF
HE
SAID
ANYTHING
FURTHER
AFTER
THAT
IT
WAS
LOST
THE
HATCHWAY
SEALED
ITSELF
TIGHT
AND
ALL
SOUND
WAS
LOST
BUT
THE
FAINT
DISTANT
HUM
OF
THE
SHIP
S
ENGINES
THEY
WERE
IN
A
BRIGHTLY
POLISHED
CYLINDRICAL
CHAMBER
ABOUT
SIX
FEET
IN
DIAMETER
AND
TEN
FEET
LONG
POTENTIALLY
BRIGHT
LAD
I
THOUGHT
HE
SAID
AND
SLUMPED
AGAINST
THE
CURVED
WALL
ARTHUR
WAS
STILL
LYING
IN
THE
CURVE
OF
THE
FLOOR
WHERE
HE
HAD
FALLEN
HE
DIDN
T
LOOK
UP
HE
JUST
LAY
PANTING
WE
RE
TRAPPED
NOW
AREN
T
WE
YES
SAID
FORD
WE
RE
TRAPPED
WELL
DIDN
T
YOU
THINK
OF
ANYTHING
I
THOUGHT
YOU
SAID
YOU
WERE
GOING
TO
THINK
OF
SOMETHING
PERHAPS
YOU
THOUGHT
OF
SOMETHING
AND
DIDN
T
NOTICE
OH
YES
I
THOUGHT
OF
SOMETHING
PANTED
FORD
ARTHUR
LOOKED
UP
EXPECTANTLY
BUT
UNFORTUNATELY
CONTINUED
FORD
IT
RATHER
INVOLVED
BEING
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THIS
AIRTIGHT
HATCHWAY
HE
KICKED
THE
HATCH
THEY
D
JUST
BEEN
THROUGH
BUT
IT
WAS
A
GOOD
IDEA
WAS
IT
OH
YES
VERY
NEAT
WHAT
WAS
IT
WELL
I
HADN
T
WORKED
OUT
THE
DETAILS
YET
NOT
MUCH
POINT
NOW
IS
THERE
SO
ER
WHAT
HAPPENS
NEXT
OH
ER
WELL
THE
HATCHWAY
IN
FRONT
OF
US
WILL
OPEN
AUTOMATICALLY
IN
A
FEW
MOMENTS
AND
WE
WILL
SHOOT
OUT
INTO
DEEP
SPACE
I
EXPECT
AND
ASPHYXICATE
IF
YOU
TAKE
A
LUNGFUL
OF
AIR
WITH
YOU
YOU
CAN
LAST
FOR
UP
TO
THIRTY
SECONDS
OF
COURSE
SAID
FORD
HE
STUCK
HIS
HANDS
BEHIND
HIS
BACK
RAISED
HIS
EYEBROWS
AND
STARTED
TO
HUM
AN
OLD
BETELGEUSIAN
BATTLE
HYMN
TO
ARTHUR
S
EYES
HE
SUDDENLY
LOOKED
VERY
ALIEN
SO
THIS
IS
IT
SAID
ARTHUR
WE
RE
GOING
TO
DIE
YES
SAID
FORD
EXCEPT
NO
WAIT
A
MINUTE
HE
SUDDENLY
LUNGED
ACROSS
THE
CHAMBER
AT
SOMETHING
BEHIND
ARTHUR
S
LINE
OF
VISION
WHAT
S
THIS
SWITCH
HE
CRIED
WHAT
WHERE
CRIED
ARTHUR
TWISTING
ROUND
NO
I
WAS
ONLY
FOOLING
SAID
FORD
WE
ARE
GOING
TO
DIE
AFTER
ALL
HE
SLUMPED
AGAINST
THE
WALL
AGAIN
AND
CARRIED
ON
THE
TUNE
FROM
WHERE
HE
LEFT
OFF
YOU
KNOW
SAID
ARTHUR
IT
S
AT
TIMES
LIKE
THIS
WHEN
I
M
TRAPPED
IN
A
VOGON
AIRLOCK
WITH
A
MAN
FROM
BETELGEUSE
AND
ABOUT
TO
DIE
OF
ASPHYXICATION
IN
DEEP
SPACE
THAT
I
REALLY
WISH
I
D
LISTENED
TO
WHAT
MY
MOTHER
TOLD
ME
WHEN
I
WAS
YOUNG
WHY
WHAT
DID
SHE
TELL
YOU
I
DON
T
KNOW
I
DIDN
T
LISTEN
OH
FORD
CARRIED
ON
HUMMING
THIS
IS
TERRIFIC
ARTHUR
THOUGHT
TO
HIMSELF
NELSON
S
COLUMN
HAS
GONE
MCDONALD
S
HAVE
GONE
ALL
THAT
S
LEFT
IS
ME
AND
THE
WORDS
MOSTLY
HARMLESS
ANY
SECOND
NOW
ALL
THAT
WILL
BE
LEFT
IS
MOSTLY
HARMLESS
AND
YESTERDAY
THE

SEEMED
TO
BE
GOING
SO
WELL
A

WHIRRED
A
SLIGHT
HISS
BUILT
INTO
A
DEAFENING

OF

WITH

IMPOSSIBLY

CHAPTER

THE
HITCH
HIKER
S
GUIDE
TO
THE
GALAXY
IS
A
WHOLLY
REMARKABLE
BOOK
IT
HAS
BEEN
COMPILED
AND
RECOMPILED
MANY
TIMES
OVER
MANY
YEARS
AND
UNDER
MANY
DIFFERENT
EDITORSHIPS
IT
CONTAINS
CONTRIBUTIONS
FROM
COUNTLESS
NUMBERS
OF
TRAVELLERS
AND
RESEARCHERS
THE
INTRODUCTION
BEGINS
LIKE
THIS
SPACE
IT
SAYS
IS
BIG
REALLY
BIG
YOU
JUST
WON
T
BELIEVE
HOW
VASTLY
HUGELY
MINDBOGGINGLY
BIG
IT
IS
I
MEAN
YOU
MAY
THINK
IT
S
A
LONG
WAY
DOWN
THE
ROAD
TO
THE
CHEMIST
BUT
THAT
S
JUST
PEANUTS
TO
SPACE
LISTEN
AND
SO
ON
AFTER
A
WHILE
THE
STYLE
SETTLES
DOWN
A
BIT
AND
IT
BEGINS
TO
TELL
YOU
THINGS
YOU
REALLY
NEED
TO
KNOW
LIKE
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
FABULOUSLY
BEAUTIFUL
PLANET
BETHSELAMIN
IS
NOW
SO
WORRIED
ABOUT
THE
CUMULATIVE
EROSION
BY
TEN
BILLION
VISITING
TOURISTS
A
YEAR
THAT
ANY
NET
IMBALANCE
BETWEEN
THE
AMOUNT
YOU
EAT
AND
THE
AMOUNT
YOU
EXCRETE
WHILST
ON
THE
PLANET
IS
SURGICALLY
REMOVED
FROM
YOUR
BODYWEIGHT
WHEN
YOU
LEAVE
SO
EVERY
TIME
YOU
GO
TO
THE
LAVATORY
IT
IS
VITALLY
IMPORTANT
TO
GET
A
RECEIPT
TO
BE
FAIR
THOUGH
WHEN
CONFRONTED
BY
THE
SHEER
ENORMITY
OF
DISTANCES
BETWEEN
THE
STARS
BETTER
MINDS
THAN
THE
ONE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
GUIDE
S
INTRODUCTION
HAVE
FALTERED
SOME
INVITE
YOU
TO
CONSIDER
FOR
A
MOMENT
A
PEANUT
IN
READING
AND
A
SMALL
WALNUT
IN
JOHANNESBURG
AND
OTHER
SUCH
DIZZYING
CONCEPTS
THE
SIMPLE
TRUTH
IS
THAT
INTERSTELLAR
DISTANCES
WILL
NOT
FIT
INTO
THE
HUMAN
IMAGINATION
EVEN
LIGHT
WHICH
TRAVELS
SO
FAST
THAT
IT
TAKES
MOST
RACES
THOUSANDS
OF
YEARS
TO
REALIZE
THAT
IT
TRAVELS
AT
ALL
TAKES
TIME
TO
JOURNEY
BETWEEN
THE
STARS
IT
TAKES
EIGHT
MINUTES
FROM
THE
STAR
SOL
TO
THE
PLACE
WHERE
THE
EARTH
USED
TO
BE
AND
FOUR
YEARS
MORE
TO
ARRIVE
AT

NEIGHBOUR

FOR

TO
REACH
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE

IT
TO
REACH
DAMOGRAN
FOR

TAKES
RATHER
LONGER
FIVE
HUNDRED
THOUSAND
YEARS
THE
RECORD
FOR
HITCH
HIKING
THIS
DISTANCE
IS
JUST
UNDER
FIVE
YEARS
BUT
YOU
DON
T
GET
TO
SEE
MUCH
ON
THE
WAY
THE
HITCH
HIKER
S
GUIDE
TO
THE
GALAXY
SAYS
THAT
IF
YOU
HOLD
A
LUNGFUL
OF
AIR
YOU
CAN
SURVIVE
IN
THE
TOTAL
VACUUM
OF
SPACE
FOR
ABOUT
THIRTY
SECONDS
HOWEVER
IT
GOES
ON
TO
SAY
THAT
WHAT
WITH
SPACE
BEING
THE
MIND
BOGGLING
SIZE
IT
IS
THE
CHANCES
OF
GETTING
PICKED
UP
BY
ANOTHER
SHIP
WITHIN
THOSE
THIRTY
SECONDS
ARE
TWO
TO
THE
POWER
OF
TWO
HUNDRED
AND
SIXTY
SEVEN
THOUSAND
SEVEN
HUNDRED
AND
NINE
TO
ONE
AGAINST
BY
A
TOTALLY
STAGGERING
COINCIDENCE
THAT
IS
ALSO
THE
TELEPHONE
NUMBER
OF
AN
ISLINGTON
FLAT
WHERE
ARTHUR
ONCE
WENT
TO
A
VERY
GOOD
PARTY
AND
MET
A
VERY
NICE
GIRL
WHOM
HE
TOTALLY
FAILED
TO
GET
OFF
WITH
SHE
WENT
OFF
WITH
A
GATECRASHER
THOUGH
THE
PLANET
EARTH
THE
ISLINGTON
FLAT
AND
THE
TELEPHONE
HAVE
ALL
NOW
BEEN
DEMOLISHED
IT
IS
COMFORTING
TO
REFLECT
THAT
THEY
ARE
ALL
IN
SOME
SMALL
WAY
COMMEMORATED
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
TWENTY
NINE
SECONDS
LATER
FORD
AND
ARTHUR
WERE
RESCUED
CHAPTER

A
COMPUTER
CHATTED
TO
ITSELF
IN
ALARM
AS
IT
NOTICED
AN
AIRLOCK
OPEN
AND
CLOSE
ITSELF
FOR
NO
APPARENT
REASON
THIS
WAS
BECAUSE
REASON
WAS
IN
FACT
OUT
TO

A

HAD
JUST
APPEARED
IN
THE

IT
WAS
EXACTLY
A

OF
CHOLESTEROL
POISONING
SOME
WEEKS
LATER
THE

OF
A
SECOND
FOR
WHICH
THE

EXISTED
REVERBERATED
BACKWARDS
AND
FORWARDS
THROUGH
TIME
IN
A
MOST
IMPROBABLE
FASHION
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
DEEPLY
REMOTE
PAST
IT
SERIOUSLY
TRAUMATIZED
A

OF

DRIFTING
THROUGH
THE

THEM
CLING
TOGETHER
IN

THESE
PATTERNS
QUICKLY
LEARNT
TO

THEMSELVES
THIS
WAS
PART
OF
WHAT
WAS
SO
EXTRAORDINARY
OF
THE
PATTERNS
AND
WENT
ON
TO
CAUSE
MASSIVE
TROUBLE
ON
EVERY

OPENED

IN
CONSIDERABLE
SURPRISE
GOOD

ARTHUR
IT
LOOKS
JUST
LIKE
THE
SEA
FRONT
AT
SOUTHEND
HELL
I
M
RELIEVED
TO
HEAR
YOU
SAY
THAT
SAID
FORD
WHY
BECAUSE
I
THOUGHT
I

BE
GOING
MAD
PERHAPS
YOU

AND
THE
ELDERBERRY
BUSH
FULL
OF
KIPPERS
YES
I
DON
T
KNOW
JUST
SOMEONE
AH
THEY
BOTH
SAT
ON
THE
PAVEMENT
AND
WATCHED
WITH
A
CERTAIN
UNEASE
AS
HUGE
CHILDREN
BOUNCED
HEAVILY
ALONG
THE
SAND
AND
WILD
HORSES
THUNDERED
THROUGH
THE

TAKING
FRESH

TO
THE
UNCERTAIN
AREAS
YOU
KNOW
SAID
ARTHUR
WITH
A
SLIGHT
COUGH
IF
THIS
IS
SOUTHEND
THERE
S
SOMETHING
VERY
ODD
ABOUT
IT
YOU
MEAN
THE
WAY
THE
SEA
STAYS
STEADY
AND
THE
BUILDINGS
KEEP
WASHING
UP
AND
DOWN
SAID
FORD
YES
I
THOUGHT
THAT
WAS
ODD
TOO
IN
FACT
HE
CONTINUED
AS
WITH
A
HUGE
BANG
SOUTHEND
SPLIT
ITSELF
INTO
SIX
EQUAL
SEGMENTS
WHICH
DANCED
AND
SPAN
GIDDILY
ROUND
EACH
OTHER
IN
LEWD
AND
LICENTIOUS
FORMATION
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
ALTOGETHER
VERY
STRANGE
GOING
ON
WILD
YOWLING
NOISES
OF

AND
STRINGS
SEARED
THROUGH
THE
WIND
HOT
DOUGHNUTS
POPPED
OUT
OF
THE

FOR
TEN
PENCE
EACH
HORRID
FISH
STORMED
OUT
OF
THE
SKY
AND
ARTHUR
AND
FORD
DECIDED
TO
MAKE
A
RUN
FOR
IT
THEY
PLUNGED
THROUGH
HEAVY
WALLS
OF
SOUND
MOUNTAINS
OF
ARCHAIC
THOUGHT
VALLEYS
OF
MOOD
MUSIC
BAD
SHOE
SESSIONS
AND
FOOTLING
BATS
AND
SUDDENLY
HEARD
A
GIRL
S
VOICE
IT
SOUNDED
QUITE
A
SENSIBLE
VOICE
BUT
IT
JUST
SAID
TWO
TO
THE
POWER
OF
ONE
HUNDRED
THOUSAND
TO
ONE
AGAINST
AND
FALLING
AND
THAT
WAS
ALL
FORD
SKIDDED
DOWN
A
BEAM
OF
LIGHT
AND
SPAN
ROUND
TRYING
TO
FIND
A
SOURCE
FOR
THE
VOICE
BUT
COULD
SEE
NOTHING
HE
COULD
SERIOUSLY
BELIEVE
IN
WHAT
WAS
THAT
VOICE
SHOUTED
ARTHUR
I
DON
T
KNOW
YELLED
FORD
I
DON
T
KNOW
IT
SOUNDED
LIKE
A
MEASUREMENT
OF
PROBABILITY
PROBABILITY
WHAT
DO
YOU

PROBABILITY
YOU

LIKE
TWO

THREE
TO
ONE
FIVE
TO
FOUR
AGAINST
IT
SAID
TWO
TO
THE

AGAINST
THAT
S
PRETTY
IMPROBABLE
YOU
KNOW
A
MILLION
GALLON
VAT
OF
CUSTARD
UPENDED

OVER
THEM
WITHOUT

BUT
WHAT
DOES
IT
MEAN
CRIED
ARTHUR
WHAT

THE
MEASUREMENT
OF
PROBABILITY
I
DON
T

I
DON

KNOW
AT

I
THINK
WE
RE
ON
SOME
KIND
OF

I

BE
MELTING
AWAY
THE
STARS

SWIRLING

YOU
WHAT

OF
WHICH
IS
ON

SEE
OR

AROUND
YOU
YOU
ARE

FEEL
SOME
INITIAL

EFFECTS
AS
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
RESCUED
FROM
CERTAIN
DEATH
AT
AN
IMPROBABILITY
LEVEL
OF

TO
THE

OF

HUNDRED
AND
SEVENTY
SIX
THOUSAND
TO

POSSIBLY
MUCH

WE
ARE
NOW
CRUISING
AT
A
LEVEL
OF

TO
THE

OF
TWENTY
FIVE
THOUSAND
TO

AGAINST

FALLING
AND
WE
WILL
BE
RESTORING

JUST
AS
SOON
AS
WE
ARE
SURE
WHAT
IS
NORMAL
ANYWAY
THANK
YOU
TWO
TO
THE

OF
TWENTY
THOUSAND

AGAINST
AND
FALLING
THE
VOICE
CUT
OUT
FORD
AND
ARTHUR
WERE
IN
A
SMALL
LUMINOUS
PINK
CUBICLE
FORD
WAS
WILDLY
EXCITED
ARTHUR
HE
SAID
THIS
IS
FANTASTIC
WE
VE
BEEN
PICKED
UP
BY
A
SHIP
POWERED
BY
THE
INFINITE
IMPROBABILITY
DRIVE
THIS
IS
INCREDIBLE
I
HEARD
RUMORS
ABOUT
IT
BEFORE
THEY
WERE
ALL
OFFICIALLY
DENIED
BUT
THEY
MUST
HAVE
DONE
IT
THEY
VE
BUILT
THE
IMPROBABILITY
DRIVE
ARTHUR
THIS
IS
ARTHUR
WHAT
S
HAPPENING
ARTHUR
HAD
JAMMED
HIMSELF
AGAINST
THE
DOOR
TO
THE
CUBICLE
TRYING
TO
HOLD
IT
CLOSED
BUT
IT
WAS
ILL
FITTING
TINY
FURRY
LITTLE
HANDS
WERE
SQUEEZING
THEMSELVES
THROUGH
THE
CRACKS
THEIR
FINGERS
WERE
INKSTAINED
TINY
VOICES
CHATTERED
INSANELY
ARTHUR
LOOKED
UP
FORD
HE
SAID
THERE
S
AN
INFINITE
NUMBER
OF
MONKEYS
OUTSIDE
WHO
WANT
TO
TALK
TO
US
ABOUT
THIS
SCRIPT
FOR
HAMLET
THEY
VE
WORKED
OUT
CHAPTER
10
THE
INFINITE
IMPROBABILITY
DRIVE
IS
A
WONDERFUL
NEW
METHOD
OF
CROSSING
VAST
INTERSTELLAR
DISTANCES
IN
A
MERE
NOTHINGTH
OF
A
SECOND
WITHOUT
ALL
THAT
TEDIOUS
MUCKING
ABOUT
IN
HYPERSPACE
IT
WAS
DISCOVERED
BY
A
LUCKY
CHANCE
AND
THEN
DEVELOPED
INTO
A
GOVERNABLE
FORM
OF
PROPULSION
BY
THE
GALACTIC
GOVERNMENT
S
RESEARCH
TEAM
ON
DAMOGRAN
THIS
BRIEFLY
IS
THE
STORY
OF
ITS
DISCOVERY
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
GENERATING
SMALL
AMOUNTS
OF
FINITE
IMPROBABILITY
BY
SIMPLY
HOOKING
THE
LOGIC
CIRCUITS
OF
A
BAMBLEWEENY
57
SUB
MESON
BRAIN
TO
AN
ATOMIC
VECTOR
PLOTTER
SUSPENDED
IN
A
STRONG
BROWNIAN
MOTION
PRODUCER
SAY
A
NICE
HOT
CUP
OF
TEA
WERE
OF
COURSE
WELL
UNDERSTOOD
AND
SUCH
GENERATORS
WERE
OFTEN
USED
TO
BREAK
THE
ICE
AT
PARTIES
BY
MAKING
ALL
THE
MOLECULES
IN
THE
HOSTESS
S
UNDERGARMENTS
LEAP
SIMULTANEOUSLY
ONE
FOOT
TO
THE
LEFT
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
THE
THEORY
OF
INDETERMINACY
MANY
RESPECTABLE
PHYSICISTS
SAID
THAT
THEY
WEREN
T
GOING
TO
STAND
FOR
THIS
PARTLY
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
A
DEBASEMENT
OF
SCIENCE
BUT
MOSTLY
BECAUSE
THEY
DIDN
T
GET
INVITED
TO
THOSE
SORT
OF
PARTIES
ANOTHER
THING
THEY
COULDN
T
STAND
WAS
THE
PERPETUAL
FAILURE
THEY
ENCOUNTERED
IN
TRYING
TO
CONSTRUCT
A
MACHINE
WHICH
COULD
GENERATE
THE
INFINITE
IMPROBABILITY
FIELD
NEEDED
TO
FLIP
A
SPACESHIP
ACROSS
THE
MIND
PARALYSING
DISTANCES
BETWEEN
THE
FURTHEST
STARS
AND
IN
THE
END
THEY
GRUMPILY
ANNOUNCED
THAT
SUCH
A
MACHINE
WAS
VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE
THEN
ONE
DAY
A
STUDENT
WHO
HAD
BEEN
LEFT
TO
SWEEP
UP
THE
LAB
AFTER
A
PARTICULARLY
UNSUCCESSFUL
PARTY
FOUND
HIMSELF
REASONING
THIS
WAY
IF
HE
THOUGHT
TO
HIMSELF
SUCH
A
MACHINE
IS
A
VIRTUAL
IMPOSSIBILITY
THEN
IT
MUST
LOGICALLY
BE
A
FINITE
IMPROBABILITY
SO
ALL
I
HAVE
TO
DO
IN
ORDER
TO
MAKE
ONE
IS
TO
WORK
OUT
EXACTLY
HOW
IMPROBABLE
IT
IS
FEED
THAT
FIGURE
INTO
THE
FINITE
IMPROBABILITY
GENERATOR
GIVE
IT
A
FRESH
CUP
OF
REALLY
HOT
TEA
AND
TURN
IT
ON
HE
DID
THIS
AND
WAS
RATHER
STARTLED
TO
DISCOVER
THAT
HE
HAD
MANAGED
TO
CREATE
THE
LONG
SOUGHT
AFTER
GOLDEN
INFINITE
IMPROBABILITY
GENERATOR
OUT
OF
THIN
AIR
IT
STARTLED
HIM
EVEN
MORE
WHEN
JUST
AFTER
HE
WAS
AWARDED
THE
GALACTIC
INSTITUTE
S
PRIZE
FOR
EXTREME
CLEVERNESS
HE
GOT
LYNCHED
BY
A
RAMPAGING
MOB
OF
RESPECTABLE
PHYSICISTS
WHO
HAD
FINALLY
REALIZED
THAT
THE
ONE
THING
THEY
REALLY
COULDN
T
STAND
WAS
A
SMARTASS
CHAPTER
11
THE
IMPROBABILITY
PROOF
CONTROL
CABIN
OF
THE
HEART
OF
GOLD
LOOKED
LIKE
A
PERFECTLY
CONVENTIONAL
SPACESHIP
EXCEPT
THAT
IT
WAS
PERFECTLY
CLEAN
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
SO
NEW
SOME
OF
THE
CONTROL
SEATS
HADN
T
HAD
THE
PLASTIC
WRAPPING
TAKEN
OFF
YET
THE
CABIN
WAS
MOSTLY
WHITE
OBLONG
AND
ABOUT
THE
SIZE
OF
A
SMALLISH
RESTAURANT
IN
FACT
IT
WASN
T
PERFECTLY
OBLONG
THE
TWO
LONG
WALLS
WERE
RAKED
ROUND
IN
A
SLIGHT
PARALLEL
CURVE
AND
ALL
THE
ANGLES
AND
CORNERS
WERE
CONTOURED
IN
EXCITINGLY
CHUNKY
SHAPES
THE
TRUTH
OF
THE
MATTER
IS
THAT
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
GREAT
DEAL
SIMPLER
AND
MORE
PRACTICAL
TO
BUILD
THE
CABIN
AS
AN
ORDINARY
THREE
DIMENSIONAL
OBLONG
ROM
BUT
THEN
THE
DESIGNERS
WOULD
HAVE
GOT
MISERABLE
AS
IT
WAS
THE
CABIN
LOOKED
EXCITINGLY
PURPOSEFUL
WITH
LARGE
VIDEO
SCREENS
RANGED
OVER
THE
CONTROL
AND
GUIDANCE
SYSTEM
PANELS
ON
THE
CONCAVE
WALL
AND
LONG
BANKS
OF

SET
INTO
THE
CONVEX
WALL
IN
ONE
CORNER
A
ROBOT
SAT
HUMPED
ITS
GLEAMING
BRUSHED
STEEL
HEAD
HANGING
LOOSELY
BETWEEN
ITS
GLEAMING
BRUSHED
STEEL
KNEES
IT
TOO
WAS
FAIRLY
NEW
BUT
THOUGH
IT
WAS
BEAUTIFULLY
CONSTRUCTED
AND
POLISHED
IT
SOMEHOW
LOOKED
AS
IF
THE
VARIOUS
PARTS
OF
ITS
MORE
OR
LESS
HUMANOID
BODY
DIDN
T
QUITE
FIT
PROPERLY
IN
FACT
THEY
FITTED
PERFECTLY
WELL
BUT
SOMETHING
IN
ITS
BEARING
SUGGESTED
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
HAVE
FITTED
BETTER
ZAPHOD
BEEBLEBROX
PACED
NERVOUSLY
UP
AND
DOWN
THE
CABIN
BRUSHING
HIS
HANDS
OVER
PIECES
OF

AND

WITH
EXCITEMENT
TRILLIAN
SAT
HUNCHED
OVER
A
CLUMP
OF

READING
OFF

HER
VOICE
WAS
CARRIED
ROUND
THE
TANNOY
SYSTEM
OF
THE
WHOLE
SHIP
FIVE

SHE
SAID
FOUR
TO

AGAINST
AND
FALLING
THREE
TO
ONE
TWO
ONE
PROBABILITY
FACTOR
OF
ONE
TO
ONE
WE
HAVE
NORMALITY
I
REPEAT
WE
HAVE
NORMALITY
SHE
TURNED
HER
MICROPHONE
OFF
THEN
TURNED
IT
BACK
ON
WITH
A
SLIGHT
SMILE
AND
CONTINUED
ANYTHING
YOU
STILL
CAN
T
COPE
WITH
IS
THEREFORE
YOUR
OWN
PROBLEM
PLEASE
RELAX
YOU
WILL
BE
SENT
FOR
SOON
ZAPHOD
BURST
OUT
IN
ANNOYANCE
WHO
ARE
THEY
TRILLIAN
TRILLIAN
SPAN
HER
SEAT
ROUND
TO
FACE
HIM
AND
SHRUGGED
JUST
A
COUPLE
OF
GUYS
WE
SEEM
TO
HAVE
PICKED
UP
IN
OPEN
SPACE
SHE
SAID
SECTION
ZZ9
PLURAL
Z
ALPHA
YEAH
WELL
THAT
S
A
VERY
SWEET
THOUGHT
TRILLIAN
COMPLAINED
ZAPHOD
BUT
DO
YOU
REALLY
THINK
IT
S
WISE
UNDER
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
I
MEAN
HERE
WE
ARE
ON
THE
RUN
AND
EVERYTHING
WE
MUST
HAVE
THE
POLICE
OF
HALF
THE
GALAXY
AFTER
US
BY
NOW
AND
WE
STOP
TO
PICK
UP
HITCH
HIKERS
OK
SO
TEN
OUT
OF
TEN
FOR
STYLE
BUT
MINUS
SEVERAL
MILLION
FOR
GOOD
THINKING
YEAH
HE
TAPPED
IRRITABLY
AT
A
CONTROL
PANEL
TRILLIAN
QUIETLY
MOVED
HIS
HAND
BEFORE
HE
TAPPED
ANYTHING
IMPORTANT
WHATEVER
ZAPHOD
S
QUALITIES
OF
MIND
MIGHT
INCLUDE
DASH
BRAVADO
CONCEIT
HE
WAS
MECHANICALLY
INEPT
AND
COULD
EASILY
BLOW
THE
SHIP
UP
WITH
AN
EXTRAVAGANT
GESTURE
TRILLIAN
HAD
COME
TO
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
MAIN
REASON
WHY
HE
HAD
HAD
SUCH
A
WILD
AND
SUCCESSFUL
LIFE
THAT
HE
NEVER
REALLY
UNDERSTOOD
THE
SIGNIFICANCE
OF
ANYTHING
HE
DID
ZAPHOD
SHE
SAID
PATIENTLY
THEY
WERE
FLOATING
UNPROTECTED
IN
OPEN
SPACE
YOU
WOULDN
T
WANT
THEM
TO
HAVE
DIED
WOULD
YOU
WELL
YOU
KNOW
NO
NOT
AS
SUCH
BUT
NOT
AS
SUCH
NOT
DIE
AS
SUCH
BUT
TRILLIAN
COCKED
HER
HEAD
ON
ONE
SIDE
WELL
MAYBE
SOMEONE
ELSE
MIGHT
HAVE
PICKED
THEM
UP
LATER
A
SECOND
LATER
AND
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
DEAD
YEAH
SO
IF
YOU
D
TAKEN
THE
TROUBLE
TO
THINK
ABOUT
THE
PROBLEM
A
BIT
LONGER
IT
WOULD
HAVE
GONE
AWAY
YOU
D
BEEN
HAPPY
TO
LET
THEM
DIE
WELL
YOU
KNOW
NOT
HAPPY
AS
SUCH
BUT
ANYWAY
SAID
TRILLIAN
TURNING
BACK
TO
THE
CONTROLS
I
DIDN
T
PICK
THEM
UP
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
WHO
PICKED
THEM
UP
THEN
THE
SHIP
DID
HUH
THE
SHIP
DID
ALL
BY
ITSELF
HUH
WHILST
WE
WERE
IN
IMPROBABILITY
DRIVE
BUT
THAT
S
INCREDIBLE
NO
ZAPHOD
JUST
VERY
VERY
IMPROBABLE
ER
YEAH
LOOK
ZAPHOD
SHE
SAID
PATTING
HIS
ARM
DON
T
WORRY
ABOUT
THE
ALIENS
THEY
RE
JUST
A
COUPLE
OF
GUYS
I
EXPECT
I
LL
SEND
THE
ROBOT
DOWN
TO
GET
THEM
AND
BRING
THEM
UP
HERE
HEY
MARVIN
IN
THE
CORNER
THE
ROBOT
S
HEAD
SWUNG
UP
SHARPLY
BUT
THEN
WOBBLED
ABOUT
IMPERCEPTIBLY
IT
PULLED
ITSELF
UP
TO
ITS
FEET
AS
IF
IT
WAS
ABOUT
FIVE
POUNDS
HEAVIER
THAT
IT
ACTUALLY
WAS
AND
MADE
WHAT
AN
OUTSIDE
OBSERVER
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
WAS
A
HEROIC
EFFORT
TO
CROSS
THE
ROOM
IT
STOPPED
IN
FRONT
OF
TRILLIAN
AND
SEEMED
TO
STARE
THROUGH
HER
LEFT
SHOULDER
I
THINK
YOU
OUGHT
TO
KNOW
I
M
FEELING
VERY
DEPRESSED
IT
SAID
ITS
VOICE
WAS
LOW
AND
HOPELESS
OH
GOD
MUTTERED
ZAPHOD
AND
SLUMPED
INTO
A
SEAT
WELL
SAID
TRILLIAN
IN
A
BRIGHT
COMPASSIONATE
TONE

CREW

ILL
AT

KNOWING
THAT
THEY
HAD
BEEN
BROUGHT
TOGETHER
NOT
OF
THEIR
OWN
VOLITION
OR
BY
SIMPLE
COINCIDENCE
BUT
BY
SOME
CURIOUS
PRINCIPLE
OF
PHYSICS
AS
IF
RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN
PEOPLE
WERE
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
THE
SAME
LAWS
THAT
GOVERNED
THE
RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN
ATOMS
AND
MOLECULES
AS

ARTIFICIAL

GRATEFUL

SAT
ON

WHITE
MICE

WAS
DISTURBED
BY
HER
NEGATIVE
REACTION
TO
THE
PLANET
S
DESTRUCTION
IT
SEEMED
REMOTE
AND
UNREAL
AND
SHE
COULD
FIND
NO
THOUGHTS
TO
THINK
ABOUT
IT
SHE
WATCHED
THE
MICE
SCURRYING
ROUND
THE
CAGE
AND
RUNNING
FURIOUSLY
IN
THEIR
LITTLE
PLASTIC
TREADWHEELS
TILL
THEY
OCCUPIED
HER
WHOLE
ATTENTION
SUDDENLY
SHE
SHOOK
HERSELF
AND
WENT
BACK
TO
THE
BRIDGE
TO
WATCH
OVER
THE
TINY
FLASHING
LIGHTS
AND
FIGURES
THAT
CHARTED
THE
SHIP

PROGRESS
THROUGH

AS
LONG
AS
HE
COULD
REMEMBER
HE
D
SUFFERED
FROM
A
VAGUE
NAGGING
FEELING
OF
BEING
NOT
ALL
THERE
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
HE
WAS
ABLE
TO
PUT
THIS
THOUGHT
ASIDE
AND
NOT
WORRY
ABOUT
IT
BUT
IT
HAD
BEEN
RE
AWAKENED
BY
THE
SUDDEN
INEXPLICABLE
ARRIVAL
OF
FORD
PREFECT
AND
ARTHUR

SOMEHOW
IT
SEEMED
TO
CONFORM
TO
A
